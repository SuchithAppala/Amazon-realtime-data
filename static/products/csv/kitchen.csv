I LOVE this product and I don't write reviews usually. For under 20 dollars... as someone who is recently dx as celiac and get cross contamination from lots of pots and pans in the house, this has been a life saver. Very easy to clean, I find soaking a paper towel with avocado oil/high heat non-seed oil and using it on the trays for omlette/poached eggs works to grease the pans if you don't have spray. Very easy to clean. Only complaint is that if you fill the cup to ""soft boiled,"" often times the white still comes out runny. Maybe that is due to where I position the lid/vent. Maybe my eggs are starting too cold. But any way you slice it, this is a very useful gadget and I used to think something like this was not useful.

What I really appreciate is the versatility. Whether I want hard-boiled, soft-boiled, poached, or scrambled eggs, this little machine does it all. The buzzer lets me know when they’re ready, and the eggs peel easily every time, which used to be a huge hassle for me. It’s perfect for meal prepping or making breakfast in a hurry.

The compact size is also a plus since it doesn’t take up much counter space, and it’s super easy to clean afterward. I’ve even used it to steam veggies a couple of times, which was a pleasant surprise.

Overall, I’m really happy with this egg cooker. It’s fast, efficient, and makes breakfast prep so much easier.

Highly Recommend!,"My grocery store sells peeled hard-boiled eggs but they cost twice as much as making them myself. I rarely make them because it's such a production. So I decided to get an egg cooker to save some time and money. After reading a zillion reviews here I bought  the Dash and am so glad I did!

Operation is dead simple and it looks cute on my counter. When the water is boiled away the cooker stops and makes a sweet chiming sound that's loud enough to hear but not so loud as to be jarring. It continues to chime until I come over and turn it off.

It makes PERFECT hard-boiled eggs! No complaint there. I drop them in a bowl of ice water and let them cool a long time, but they never peel as easily as people say they will. My solution is to crack and peel them under running water.

The omelette is good, too, but the poached eggs always have runny whites. I tried poaching them longer but that made the yolk hard.

I use distilled water to reduce hard water mineral buildup on the metal plate. The calcium in the eggshells leave a little buildup on the plate but It's easy to remove.

If you only care about hard-boiled eggs and omelettes then you can't do better than this little cutie! I docked it 1 star for the poached eggs. If I ever learn how to overcome that problem I'll come back and give it 5 stars.

Buzzer is not as loud or annoying as expected,"Update 2021:
This cooker is going strong and awesome as ever. I'd give it 6 stars if possible. I started using the poaching tray this year and the eggs are perfect. It is imperative to use some non-stick spray in the tray for the egg to slide out. I've had great luck using water right at or slightly below the poaching line on the water cup. I  use a little under when I am going to toss the eggs in some oatmeal to make an eggy porridge and they finish cooking in the warm oatmeal.

Update 2020: Star rating changed from 4 to 5 - this cooker is boss.
I've had this cooker over 2 years. It's been used every day for the past year at least once, often twice and occasionally more. The sediment that builds up on the plate when doing hard cooked eggs is from the water. Pouring a little vinegar on the metal plate and letting it soak for a bit cleans it right up without too much scrubbing. I do the same with the egg holder platter and stem when it looks dingy and soap doesn't clean it off. I still haven't made poached eggs in the thing but I did get adventurous and started adding spinach to my omelettes. I need to fill the water just above the omelette line and let the egg patty sit in the cooker a few minutes to avoid a gooey center but it works well and is now my preferred prep method. The buzzer is as loud today as it was the first, a pro and con at the same time. I occasionally miss the buzzer when I'm in the back of the house but it dutifully continues to buzz, although occasionally intermittently, up to an hour later. No idea if it would continue past that point, I got tired of it and turned it off.

Original review 2018:
I've had this cooker about a month and I have used it several times every week.

Hard/Medium boil: -  The marking for hard boil on the cup resulted in eggs that had a slightly squishy yolk in the center which is no good for deviled eggs so I fill the water cup almost all the way to the top so it cooks a bit longer. I can boil 1 or 6 eggs at a time and they all come out the same level of doneness with the same amount of water and wait time after the buzz. I do leave them in the cooker a few minutes for a hard boil just to be sure the yolks are solid and I have yet to get any green or tough yolks doing this and the whites remain tender as well. The medium line was pretty good for the softer eggs I ate as a snack by themselves. I haven't tried making soft boiled eggs as the medium boil was as soft as I like!  VS cooking on the stove, the eggs from the cooker cool much quicker and without ice in the water, plus they peel just as easy a few days later right from the fridge. Not sure if I'd leave them past a few days as the shell needs piercing for boiling, but so far so good on 2-3 days. Also as mentioned in other reviews there is discoloration on the heating plate after boiling eggs but it doesn't occur when using either of the egg cooking platter so I do not think it is rust but sediment from the shells.

Omelette: - The markings for omelette are right on for me. I get a nice firmly formed egg that is still tender and an interesting puffy top layer. It isn't so much an omelette as a thick egg patty and perfect for a sandwich on toast or a bun. There is a bit of overhang on an english muffin, but not so much you can't make it work. The recipe booklet says you can add things like spinach to the egg in the cooker but I haven't tried that yet. After the buzzer goes off I can add some cheese to the top and cover it for a minute while bread is toasting and the cheese melts nicely. Be sure to use vegetable spray to coat the cooking cup for easy release.

Poaching: - Haven't tried poaching myself but a friend has and said it worked well. Again, need to use that spray or else it's a mess and hard to get out!

Other thoughts: - I wasn't shopping for an egg cooker, or even thought I needed one, before I saw this listed as a lightning deal around Thanksgiving. After reading so many funny and entertaining reviews regarding the buzzer I had to hear it for myself! I was a little disappointed that the sound wasn't quite the 'Klaxon of Doom' I had been expecting. It is more like a high pitched annoying perpetual buzz that you really don't want to continue listening to but could easily be missed if the washer/dryer/dishwasher was going at the same time and you're a few rooms away. Overall the cooker does a great job making it possible to get a hot breakfast made while getting ready in the morning. I've probably saved hours of time and hassle on the few dozen hard boiled eggs alone. I wouldn't be without the cooker now and aside from the urge to make a REAL omelette now and again (with 3 eggs), I am happy to let this cooker handle all of my egg cooking needs.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLETN4PX63R52,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B00DDXYC6O,2017-12-28,623.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.998,kitchen

Buying a 3rd set today.  I've thrown out all of my other storage containers.  These are the solution I have been looking for.  My refrigerator is continuously hosting these containers: cuttings, left overs, ready-to-eat foods.  I find that these containers enable a kitchen workflow that other containers cannot match.  First of all while there are 7 sizes of containers, there are only 4 sizes of lids...brilliant!  Now I don't have to dig around trying to find a container with its matching lid.  This system has changed the workflow in my kitchen.  Before food storage was an afterthought.  Now, when cooking, I set out a number of these containers in anticipation.  If the dish calls for celery, instead of chopping up a couple of stalks, I chop the entire head into a pint container and throw a handful into the pot.  The reset goes into the fridge for the next dish.  I find that if I cook three dinners I can eat out of the fridge for the rest of the week.  We all eat better for less money.

While these containers are advertised as dishwasher safe, I've found that this does not work that well.  They will survive the dishwasher just find, but they are light and so get blown around during the cycle.  Much better just to hand wash them.

What would make this system better is a way to mark expiration date on the containers.  I have so many containers in motion it is hard to tell how long an individual container has been stored.

If you're a larger family, this will rock your casseroles. There's a been a lot written about it by others, so I'll just briefly speak to the features that impressed me the most (or you can skip right down to the last paragraph for a very short TL:DR.

 First, it's dimensions. Most small slow cookers that are less than 3 qts in volume are of the deep and narrow variety. They don't easily lend themselves to roasts, a pair of chicken breasts, a, pork tenderloin, or things of that nature. This one, with it's shallow casserole shape, excels at them. I've cooked a skinny pork tenderloin, a 2-pound rump roast, and a pair of boneless chicken breasts. None of them had to be squashed, bent, cut or otherwise compromised to fit. i'm pretty sure it would just as easily handle bone-in chicken.

This Crockpot doesn't boil liquids on the Low setting. Most slow cookers (many of them Crockpots) will bring any liquid to a boil within a few hours, no matter if you're cooking on Low or High. My rump roast took 8.5 hours on Low, and at no time did the liquid in the pot go higher than 207F, as measured on my Thermapen instant read thermometer. I want to braise my roasts, not boil them, and this Crockpot does it very well.

Serving is easy. Again, this relates to shape. There was no awkwardness when removing any of the meats I cooked. With my other slow cookers (including my Instant Pots) roasts fall apart as I try to remove them, because there's no way to get a turner under it, or grab it on both ends with a pair of long forks. Upshot, the poor roast breaks into pieces. I was able to slide a turner under the rump roast and stabilize it with tongs for easy transfer to a plate. Same with the tenderloin. And the chicken breasts were easy to pick up with tongs, grabbing the meat from the side (not from above) for a better grip. I like that! I'm planning to try lasagna next, because both times I tried it in big oval slow cookers I wasn't able to scoop out anything like a slice. It always came out in a goopy mess and the cheese combined with the sauce to turn it sort of pink. Not pretty!

Finally, I thought I'd give a shout-out to JoyouslyDomestic.com, the website where I found the recipe for ""Melt In Your Mouth"" Pot Roast. Google the recipe name and look at the photo. That's exactly what mine looked like! All rich, deep brown, glossy, beefy gravy over a gorgeous brown roast. Do NOT try to skip browning (it's really quick, I promise), it's completely worth it!

TL:DR - To recap, this is a terrific small slow cooker. It's low walls and wide base make it good for casseroles for a larger family, and also as the primary cooker for a small family. It doesn't boil on Low, and food is easy to remove from the shallow crock. I give it 5 stars.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3692J8JOD5HBN,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B012CP15H2,2019-09-01,305.0,positive,[],0.983,kitchen

PROS: This 2.5 quart CrockPot is pricey, but well worth it. The Ceramic Crock inset is light enough for me to remove & bring to the sink for easy hand washing. The aluminum base is super lightweight &  easy to wipe clean.  The wide, oval design makes it easy to prepare food in the pot & stir, as needed. I cooked a 3lb lamb roast on high for 6 hrs & it came out great. The rounded feet on the bottom keep the heated surface off the counter top. The simple, Knob control is secure & “clicks” from 1 setting to the other. The glass lid makes it easy to visually check progress without opening. The glass lid has a rubber gasket that creates a good seal when you push down on the lid, preventing splattering once the unit gets up to temp.
CONS: I do wish there was an “ON” light to remind me to turn the unit Off.  This seems like a basic safety feature, to me.
It would be great if the Ceramic Crock had handles on either side to make it easy to remove the piping hot Crock Pot to move it to the table for serving or into the oven got final cooking options. These handles could be located on the front & back so they would not interfere with the locking lid. As is, I am not able to get a grip on the hot Crock with potholders. It’s too dangerous to try to wrangle the hot Crock without getting burned. Again, this seems like a basic safety feature.

TIPS: I spent a lot of time reading Amazon reviews before deciding to purchase. There were 3 issues that kept coming up that I might be able to help with.
1. Folks have reported the glass lid shattering. I looked up the User Manual on line & it states DO NOT LOCK LID while cooking. The User Manual specifically states this may cause the glass lid to shatter. You are only suppose to lock the lid for storage & travel.
2. Folks have reported the unit does not heat up properly & food is severely undercooked or raw after 6 hrs on high. I found when I first opened the box & placed the Ceramic Crock into the Aluminum base, the fit is quite snug & the Crock was sitting about 1/2” above the rim of the base. I had to use some pressure to push the Ceramic Crock all the way into the base, until the bottom of the Crock was touching the flat bottom of the Aluminum base. There was no longer a gap between the lip of the Crock & the rim of the base. This ensures the flat bottom of the hot metal base is heating up the Crock to temperature, throughout the cooking cycle. I’ve included a pic to show there is no gap between the Crock & the Base when properly inserted.
3. Folks have noted there is no Cord Storage on the unit. For me, there are 2 easy options to store the cord. You can easily wrap the Cord around the base handle on the side -or- you can bend the Cord in half & slip it thru the handle of the cover, which is my preferred method. The Cord will stay snugly in place, either way.

The design is slick and well thought out. The app for the Meater works well and the accuracy is spot on. A green light flashes on the base if the thermoprobe is within range and connected. It flashes red if not. The app will tell you as well if you are connected. The base station will give you considerable more range than advertised, but see the next section for the caveats. The app also has settings to change the different alerts. You can only choose from their list of sounds which is considerably less than the full array you have on the iPhone, but still, there are four alarms and maybe 12 or so sounds to choose from. No need for too many. The initial settings were just fine for me. They have just updated the app to add all sorts of carnivorous delights you can cook with the probe. From venison to kangaroo. This is a nice addition as I often go in for antelope and other less common meats.

The Bad:
The instructions leave a little to be desired, but it is not hard to figure out unless you are the easily frustrated type. There is a card in the box for support and the website has support as well. The Meater + comes with a bamboo magnetic base for charging and storage and in the back it has a repeater to get to the 165' range it touts. The base (and I assume the basic Meater) must be within 33' of the base for ovens and some types of grills. For smokers it is much closer. That number is in the fine print.  In the case of the Orion Cooker I have, I can get the base station to recognize the thermoprobe about 12' away, through the smoker and the window to the breakfast nook. The base station has to stay there so it can connect to the probe. Once connected the app can pick up the base station, and thus the probe) all over my house and considerably farther away than 165'. But if someone moves the base it might disconnect and then you won't get updates or alarms and you might overcook your meat.

The Ugly
There isn't much wrong with this unit and I do recommend it to others. That said, it is a bit misleading (or just obtuse writing) which will lead you to believe that you can just plop the probe in some meat and your phone will pick it up all over the house. I read several reviews (and one YouTube video) that slammed the Meater for the short range despite the fact it is in the literature and on their site. It is probably not as prominent as it should be, but think about it, how can a little probe hold a battery, two thermoresitors, and an antennae and get 165' range? Not with today's tech I fear. Maybe when the Federation is founded. Either way, if they were a bit clearer about that for the Meater and instructions to first remove the probe before using the app. My guess is those who had issues already had the app open and so the probe paired with the phone and they didn't get the range they desired.

Some Pointers
If you turn on the app then remove the probe, the probe will connect to the app/phone and your range is now 33' (10' for a smoker). What is not said is that you have to fully exit and quit the app (swipe up on Apple), then remove the probe which causes it to pair with the base. Then open the app and your phone will pair with the base. Place the base where it is still flashing green when the probe is in the meat and the lid shut. Now you can use it all over the place. The app will show if it is connected properly and if it is not. I didn't notice where an alarm would sound if the base and probe stop syncing. If it doesn't have one that would be a nice addition. A nice loud one that vibrates as well.

Wish list
They make a basic Meater with four probes, which is a great idea if you are smoking different meats at the same time, or maybe just using the smoker, the grill, and the oven at the same time. I wish they had something like that for the Meater +. I assume it will come out at some point. Then again, I rarely would need more than one as I'm not running a restaurant.  Also, I wish the magnets on the back were a bit stronger. For some reason my fridge it will slip down a few inches before attracting to some metal large enough for it to grab onto. Other kitchen items like the pot rack and microwave side have the same issues. I just think the weight of the base, battery, and probe are too much for the magnets to support.

Bottom line, great unit, does what it says (even if you didn't read all it says). Just remember to remove the probe from the base first before opening the app or your range will be that of the basic Meater.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RWI9ZGTYRHHN,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07H8WTFHW,2020-10-26,316.0,positive,['great'],0.9944,kitchen

I highly recommend it - as long as you keep these tips in mind:

1. Make sure you understand that there are two different wireless connections going on in normal operation: one between your phone and the base and one between the base and the probe.  You can see this arrangement and the current status of each of the connections by going into the upper right menu of the main display of the app and choosing ""Connection Details"". Sometimes, the phone will connect direct to the probe skipping the base station and resulting in a weaker connection. You can see if that happens on this screen. If it does, you can try removing and replacing the base's battery or killing and restarting the phone app.

2. There are two different batteries and battery levels involved. One in the base station (replaceable AAA) and one in the probe itself (non-replaceable rechargeable). Under Connection Details, the battery level reported there is for the probe. To see the battery level for the base station, tap on its icon to go to another screen which will show the base station's battery level.

3. The probe recharges its own battery when placed in the base station. This is accomplished by the two metal contacts that hold it in place. Over time, you might see a problem with the probe charging or its battery level being unexpectedly low. What was happening in my case is the connection between one of the base clips and the probe was not working well. After repeated cooks, grease had formed a coating on the top of the probe which was interfering with the corresponding electrical contact. You can take steel wool or very high grit sand paper and gently sand the surface until the coating is gone and the metal surface looks clean again.

Once you have that information under your belt and put it to use, it works like a champ!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GVC93RCP2BUK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07H8WTFHW,2024-03-29,125.0,positive,[],0.7558,kitchen

Pulled pork success!,"My first cook with the MEATER plus was a success as judged by the positive feedback from my family. I chose a pulled pork recipe from the MEATER app and bought a pork shoulder from the nearby grocery store. It was easy to set up the thermometer for use in the app on iOS and I selected the recipe from the available “cooks”. The MEATER app walked me through everything step by step, including ingredients and short videos. I had watched it before to make sure I had the ingredients. I fired up the smoker to preheat it, put on the rub with spices at the directed time (though I used a Traeger rub instead of making my own) and then put the MEATER plus into the pork shoulder as instructed. The app started measuring the temperature inside the meat as well as the ambient temperature and reporting it to me. Once it got some data it started estimating the time to cook completion and the visual milestones were really helpful showing target temperature and current temperature. The Bluetooth connection worked well and I also set up the MEATER cloud link by having a second device with the MEATER app running with my login. This enabled me to leave the house and run errands while still monitoring the cook and this feature worked great. It was all done around eight hours after I started and using MEATER took a lot of the guesswork out of it for me. As someone new to smoking meats I really found this product to be useful. My Traeger doesn’t have the WiFi built in and by adding this MEATER plus thermometer into my arsenal it kind of put me on par with the pricier Traeger models with WiFi except I have to manually adjust the temp. Time will tell as to how durable the thermometer is but at this point I’d give it a thumbs up. It did read differently from the Traeger wired probe in the meat with the MEATER measuring about 10 degrees less. But the pulled pork still turned out great so that’s something I’ll have to figure out in terms of accuracy.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F73YMSL96LMX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07H8WTFHW,2024-03-24,9.0,positive,"['great', 'useful', 'durable']",0.9527,kitchen

Predominantly I use it to grill beef steaks like rib-eye, striploin and tenderloin. You can adjust to using it but it is better if you know these tricks:
1. Put the base very close to the grill. Better somewhere on the grill where it is not very hot. If you bring the base 20 ft. or so away, it starts losing the connection. You, with your smartphone can be much further, the app will tell you if it is disconnected from the base.
2. Set the target temperature a lot lower that you want. In general, the thicker is the cut, the lower should be the target comparing to what's the real temperature you want to achieve. For example, for a standard 1.5 inch steak, if you want 135°, set it to 125°. It tells you to remove it from the heat 5 degrees below that target but still while you wait for it to cool down, the temperature may go 10° or even 15° above your target. A very thin steak may be OK with the exact temperature, but 2"" cut will need a big adjustment, or you will overcook it. I wish I could be able to enter the depth of steak into app and it would adjust.
3. Insert the probe all the way down till the beginning of the black tip. If you leave an inch or so of the silver part out you may start getting ""close to overheat"" and ""overheat"" messages, which are very annoying and also covering the entire screen so you can't see anything. I have a low-power grill and it also has an infra-red bar, so there is no open flame, but still it does that. Nothing bad really happens, the probe is fine and working, it's just an annoying paranoic mode.
4. Always clean the back of the tip of the probe before recharging, or you may end up with ""low battery"" right before you need it. That's a contact part and it gets greasy. Use a very fine sand paper to polish it when needed.

So, yes, it is useful, I like it and my steaks improved a lot since I don't open the grill too many times, only when need to turn the steaks over.

 This ""smoking/grilling"" thermometer is, without a doubt, one of the best tools available for keeping tabs on your BBQ/grilling/smoking ""cooks"". I just received my ""Meater+"" thermometer 4 days ago and did my first cook (Boston butt) two days after it arrived. I will say, that I did a lot of research before making this purchase and as usual, there were some negative comments. I believe many of the negative comments are due to people not setting the Meater+ up correctly, especially where it concerns the "" Meater+ ""App"". I had no problem at all setting up the thermometer. Once you are ready to begin using the thermometer, open the app and follow the step-by-step directions to get everything going. One of the criticisms I read concerning the app was that the thermometer kept losing its connection to the ""repeater"" block. This is actually the charging station and case in which you keep the Meater. The charging station must stay close to the probe for it to say connected (Bluetooth). I set the the Block right next to the grill, about 3 feet away. When setting up the Meater, be sure to pair the probe and bluetooth connection FIRST.
Then open the ""app"" and the smart phone (or tablet) will pair with the ""repeater"" and give you the ability to monitor your cook from some distance, depending, of course, on what the obstruction is between you and the grill.

With the ""Meater"" you can monitor the ambient temperature, the temperature of your meat, an estimate of when the the cook will be done and you can either use a programed cook or set up your own custom parameters. The  app will log the cook and display a graph of temp fluctuations. and allows you to make notes concerning your cook. The app is one of the best, most well thought out apps I have seen.

I also monitored the temperatures with my Thermo Pro wired thermometer. The ambient temp reading was within 5 degrees throughout the entire cooking process (keep in mind the probes were not in the exact same location). The internal temp of the meat varied by as much as 20 degrees. This could also be due to the probes of the thermometers  being in different ""densities"" within the meat. I believe the accuracy of the Meater+ is spot on. If one would like to read a review of the Meater+ written by a professional ""griller"" go to ""foodfirefriends.com.

Accurate, versatile, great range, easy to use.","My husband bought me the original Meater for Christmas a few years ago, and I returned it since the range was poor and it didn't work inside most of my appliance. I have since bought the Meater Plus and I love it. Although some of my appliance have built in probes, some of them don't.

Although I do have an Instant Read probe that I still use to verify doneness of proteins, the Meater Plus is so much easier to use and you don't have to constantly check the food so it doesn't get over or undercooked. I am an experienced cook, but as you know foods can look done on the outside, but you can't see how well done they are on the inside. This Meater Plus is the perfect solution for perfectly cooked proteins and other foods.

So what do I love about the Meater Plus?
 1 - It works using an app that can be downloaded for either phones or tablets using Android or IOS operating systems.
 2 - It easily connects using Bluetooth and the Meater cloud through your router.
 3 - In the app settings, you can set your preferences for the various alarms.
 4 - When a done temperature preference is set in the app for a cook, the app will let you know when the food is done, and allow for a resting period when the temperature will increase. So, for example, if you want a medium rare steak and set the temperature for 130 degrees, the app will tell you the steak is done at 125 degrees and allow for a 5 minute resting period that the temperature will increase to 130 degrees. This means perfectly done proteins every time.
 5 - You can choose a preset in the app, and then modify it to your preference.
 6 - This probe works well to monitor food inside any oven and even in cookers like the Ninja Speedi, Ninja grills, and pressure cookers.
 7 - Cooking progress can be monitored wherever you can take your phone or tablet in the house. You don't have to stay in the kitchen.
 8- Works with rotisseries where wired probes aren't practical.
 9 - Can be connected to Alexa for notifications.
10 - The base unit is powered by an ""A"" battery, and pressing a button lets you know if the battery is still good. The probe is charged in the base unit.
11 - The base unit is magnetized so it can be stored on the side of any metal appliance. This means not having to find it in a cabinet or drawer. I have two of these, and keep them on the side of my Anova oven so they are always handy.

I have used this Meater Plus in my ovens, the Ninja Speedi, and in my pressure cookers with great results. I have the app on my phone, and can take my phone in the family room while I watch TV and still monitor the progress of my food cooking. I also like the display of the ambient temperature. This tells you whether your oven is actually getting to the temperature you set it to. In my experience, many ovens never reach the temperature you set, so trying to estimate when your food will be cooked is all guesswork. The Meater Plus takes the guesswork out of cooking. Once you set a done temperature, the app estimates when your food will be fully cooked. This make is so much easier to make sure all of the other components of your meal will be done and hot at the same time. No matter how experienced you are in cooking, there is always a certain amount of guesswork in knowing when foods are cooked to the preferred doneness. The Meater Plus eliminates some of the guesswork. I should also mention that the range of the Meater Plus is greater if you remove the probe from the holder before opening the app. This was mentioned by one other reviewer.

UPDATE 11/14/24:
I purchased 2 of these Meaters 2 years ago and I still love them. As mentioned previously, the probe should be removed from the charger before opening the app to increase the range of the probes. In the last 2 years, I have used these probes in a few ovens and pressure cookers as well as outdoor ovens and smokers. I have never been disappointed with the performance of these probes. What I love about the Meater is::

 1)  The charging units for the probes are magnetic. So, I can store them on the side of an oven where they are kept handy.
 2)  The app is so easy to use. Choose a meat you want to cook to get suggested internal temperatures for your choice, and still have the ability to modify the done temperature. You can also add and save your preferred temperatures for the meats you are cooking.
 3)  The app allows for carryover temperatures, so the app will say the food is done when it is 5 degrees less than the chosen temperature.
 4)  Whether cooking indoors or outdoors, I can monitor the progress of my cook inside and on the phone app.
 5)  The app tells you the ambient temperature of the oven or grill you are using. So, you know if the temperature is actually the temperature you set.
 6) My favorite is that the app calculates the time it will take to finish cooking, and this estimate has been spot on. For me, this is important since I try to get sides for the meal done at the same time so everything is hot for serving.

My original post can be seen at the end. Purchased again in April of this year and the experience is much better but still needs a ton of work.
This is now the 3rd time I am purchasing this product, but only 2nd time I'm actually getting to successfully use it.
What I love:
- The Ambient temperature sensor. This feature is crucial if you are serious about smoking / BBQ. The built-in thermometers on most grills and offset smokers are usually very poor quality, and give skewed readings. Because they are connected to the metal of the grill, and because they are located at the top of the cooking chamber they tend to read much hotter than the air/environment where your food is actually being cooked. The fact that I only need 1 probe to read both internal and ambient temperature is fantastic.

What needs work?
The bamboo/wooden charging case feels premium, but there's no real way to clean it. And if that thermometer isn't 100% dry when you put it back, that's just a breeding ground for mold. A major design flaw to this charging case is the fact that it doesn't have any indication of whether or not the probe is charging. Now, this may not seem like a huge deal at first, but then I ran into the same issue I had with the first unit I purchased. The first use, it works great. However, after cleaning it (I thought thoroughly enough but was proven wrong) I stored the probe back in the charging case, expecting it to be charged the next time I needed to use it. Now, a delay of needing to wait to charge this probe for a few hours can delay a BBQ project by an entire day. I woke up at 6 am this morning to start an all-day smoke to find that the probe would not power on no matter what I tried. Turned out, the probe never was charging. After contacting customer support and finding some helpful tips on Reddit, I found that even if the back charging plate looks clean, it often isn't clean enough to make a connection with the charger. The support recommended using baking soda and a coarse sponge (which I did the first 2 times I tried cleaning it). I ended up finding a post on Reddit suggesting I use fine-grit sandpaper to fully clean the back tip of the probe to ensure it would charge properly. After trying this, thankfully it was finally charging. BUT I had no way of actually knowing whether or not the probe was charging until a few hours later when I took it off the charger. I'm hoping in a future version they add a charging indicator to the case.
The software has definitely improved by leaps and bounds from my first review, but still needs a ton of work. Originally, it was incredibly difficult to remove/reset a device if you were having issues. Now, it's possible but I found that the menus were sending me in circles. Since I first tried the product, the functionality of the ""estimated cooking time remaining"" has never worked.
When the Meater+ works, it's great. But it's too inconsistent. It feels incomplete.

ORIGINAL 2021 REVIEW:
I was so excited about this! I had seen it on youtube and bought it immediately. It seems like a great idea, but executed poorly.
In the app, there is no way to specify which phone/tablet you want to use as a base station, and which one you want to have as the ""remote"" device. I was leaving my iPad out by the grill, and bringing my phone inside with me so I could view the temperature from inside. But the thermometer kept defaulting to try and connect to my phone instead of the iPad that was less than 5 feet away.

There is no easy way to connect a second device to the app, or to factory reset one.
After one use, the thermometer would not charge or connect to any device. It just died after one use. The one time it did work, it worked fantastically (if I was close enough).
I think the app UI needs some rethinking. I really wanted to keep using this, but it died after one use.
When I tried to order a replacement, my order was lost, and took a few weeks to fix the issue. I don't even want to try again. Best Buy has another brand of smart thermometer and I think I will end up trying that one instead.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FWL9EAR0FJ4O,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07H8WTFHW,2021-09-20,27.0,positive,"['great', 'love']",0.9964,kitchen

Having dogs, I didn’t want the wire for safety reasons. I also didn’t want a bunch or wires to roll up and store, and the attractiveness of the small size, self storage wooden box, no wires that could be pulled and damaged was very appealing. I read the product reviews and thought this would work as it is being used in our home, in our kitchen which isn’t large at all. After all, I’m not grilling or out on a lake in a boat where I can see connectivity being an issue, and planned on the probe, base and my phone being less than 10-12 feet from one another. Downloading the app and the instructions to get started cooking our turkey were super easy. The best part was seeing how quickly our turkey cooked to avoid dry turkey. The cooking time should have been 3.5 hours and it only took 2.25 hours. I know another 1.15 hours of cooking would have certainly resulted in a dried out bird. There are audible tones that keep you aware of what is going on as long as you maintain connectivity. The turkey was delicious; white meat was super juicy, once off the bird and plated, a knife really wasn’t necessary as a fork would do. Best turkey I’ve ever made!  The probe was easy to clean, just wiped clean. Nice looking, compact wooden base to store the probe. Love the magnetic battery compartment, no more lost or broken pieces. Downfall? Connectivity. I needed spin the turkey around to have the probe closest to the cookware drawer where I needed to put the base unit directly next to the oven and keep my phone on the counter next to the stove where I was working with liquids and other items used to prepare the meal so I could keep an eye on the app because the probe, base unit and phone lost connection multiple times. Even in doing that, the probe, base unit and my phone kept disconnecting and were not communicating. I needed to manually troubleshoot and reconnect. We lost connection over 10x, which concerned me because who wants to choke on a dry turkey or one that needs to be drowned in gravy?! Because the probe, base and my phone kept losing connection, I needed to “babysit” the connection on my phone. Isn’t this why anyone would want the MeatR+ to begin with? I attempted to contact their customer service via app email for help and needed the Amazon order number, serial number, fill out the online form. On Thanksgiving, I needed to prepare the meal, not spend 15+ minutes to get the information while the probe continued glitching and not reading the turkey temp which at that point, it was cooking fast and minutes were being shaved off at a quick rate. I was going to not even bother trying to have the probe, base and my phone reconnect as it became disappointing and more of an interruption to have to watch the app very closely while trying to get other things done. Also, using the app will eat your battery life, so start with a decent charge on your phone or have a charger handy if your phone is older. I had high hopes the MeatR+ would not lose connection for me since the turkey, prove, base unit and my phone all were in our small kitchen. Playing around where the probe, unit and my phone were was critical! I ended up needing to place the probe and unit less than 3ft from one another and my phone was on the counter less than 3.5 ft from the base unit and even then we lost connection. I kept opening the oven, opening the lower cabinet and putting my phone close to regain connection. It did every time, but I wasn’t expecting connectivity issues with everything now on aces less than 3.5 fr from one another. Our counters are granite, maybe this was the issue? The turkey was roasted in a dark blue and white speckled roasting pan (thin metal) with a single layer of foil over the top of the turkey with the lid on it. Probe was placed in the breast of the turkey with the probe turned to be closest to the lower cabinet drawer that had the base unit in. It’s a great idea, would love to have it work as intended. Maybe the company has some tips? Maybe our unit was a bum one that got literally was dropped shipped somewhere along the line? (Amazon driver stacked our delivery neatly, so IDK.)

It makes great stews, sauces, chilis, soups etc. I had the original round 4 qt CrockPot that was awesome but a bit too small, so I knew what I was getting, both the good and the not so good.
Let's start off with the not so good (which existed with EVERY low cost Rival CrockPot I ever owned):
1. They refuse to add an one-off light which tells you that the unit is on. You need to relax on touching it or seeing that the knob is turned to hi or low. This caused a slight problem when I had a short in the outlet of the last unit...you'd think it was on, but the plug was loose and works need a jiggle. My fault, but a light world be nice to verify from a distance that the unit was""on""
2. For some weird reason, they only put three legs on the base of this unit instead of four, so it could be a tiny bit tippy if you push down on the front. I don't plan on doing that, and since I'm the one using it, that's fine. Not a deal breaker.
3. As with my last unit, the back of the cooker container(where the plug is) gets a bit hotter than the the sides and front, so after a few hours, I know that with thicker sauces and chilis, it will sorta stick to that area/sorta burn (not really burn badly, just a definite hot spot area, about an inch or so, that cooks hotter). I solve it by stirring every few hours or turning the pot, sorta like turning a mattress every few months. Wish it didn't do this, but no big deal to me.
4. The outside of the unit (anywhere that's metal) gets REALLY hot. Do not touch it. The plastic handles stay cool. And don't wrap a towel or anything around it (for insulation ) or you will burn out the unit. Again, this is something I'm already aware of, I don't have kids and my cat has enough sense to not go hear it. So no it's fine for me. For those with small children etc, you may want to go with a pricier unit that is better insulated and stays chill on the outside.
5. Although this unit has a low and high setting, I really can't tell the difference. After a few hours, whatever in cooking is still boiling around the sides at both settings. I'm assuming the low heats stuff up to the same temp, but cycles less frequently (stay off longer). I dunno. If I'm not home, I leave on low all day and it's ready when I get home. If I'm home, I start stuff on high and, after three hours, I then put on low until I'm ready to eat.  I don't think I ever used the warm setting.

Again, this is all stuff I was already aware of and willing to live with..... I know how to work with this unit.  So the bottom line is that while I sorta wish they could fix some of the easier things (the light, the legs), I absolutely love the unit and the low cost. And this bigger size is perfect to make a meal that lasts for three days, the last day leftovers gets added to my Leftovers Soup™",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RA17GH8YX8MQW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/5263444f-028b-465c-bd13-7d83cb2866fe._CR109,0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",True,B003OAJGJO,2024-02-21,76.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect', 'love']",0.9925,kitchen

I've been in need of a true slow cooker for a long time, my 2 multifunction countertop cookers just didn't function well as a true slow cooker.  I wanted something simple and easy to use (old school!), durable and easy to clean, and large enough for (1) a roaster sized chicken and (2) a large batch of soup or stew.  I did not want a unit that had electronic features.

This Manual 7 Quart Crock Pot fit the bill!  An old fashioned, analog style unit that reminds me of the Crock Pots of my youth.  This crock pot is even identified as ""Classic"" on the box ... Love that!  Put a huge smile on my face when I unboxed the unit.  I knew right then I would love this Crock Pot, and I was correct.  Everything about it exceeded my expectation.
- Incredibly durable construction, including a heavy duty and secure fastener for the lid handle.  Stoneware insert is easy to take in and out, hand washes clean in a breeze.  It is oven safe to 400 degrees F if you wish to use it as a baking or roasting dish in the oven.
- This 7 quart size is the large capacity that I wanted for roaster sized chickens, and large batches of soups and stews.  Dimensions are as advertised:  16.9""D x 11.8""W x 10.4""H.
-  Love this feature:  Simple to operate!  Just turn the dial to low (low temp slow cook), high (high temp slow cook), or warm (to keep finished foods warm).
- Take care when moving the unit around, as it is heavy given its size and very durable construction.  It weighs 12.55 pounds before any food is added.

Parchment Paper Tip:  If you are cooking something that could become sticky (BBQ, pasta, or teriyaki sauce), or are baking in the Crock Pot, line the stoneware bowl with 1 or 2 layers of parchment paper before loading the bowl.  This makes clean up a breeze, and allows you to simply lift the baked item cleaning from the Crock Pot.

Easiest way to make a meal if you don't have much time,"I'll be honest, I was not much of a cook before getting married last year, and this crockpot has been an essential for me. Even though I have since learned a lot about cooking, I still use this crockpot at least once a week because it's just nice to be able to put ingredients in and then take a meal out of it later without having to put in much effort. It's great for busy, full days where you don't have much time.

I've found this 7-quart crockpot to be the perfect size for 2 people. We end up with a serving size (of meat and veggies) for both of us at dinner and then my husband is able to get a lunch out of it the next day too (so in total it typically gives me 3-4 serving sizes). I suppose if you were just making a meat or veggie or some other single food in here, you'd get more portions, but I put everything in there so I don't get many servings out of it, but it suits us perfectly fine.

Cooking low and slow is my motto with this thing. I feel like that keeps the meat from drying out. Personally, I have found that chicken breasts cook in about  2 1/2-3 hours on low and a roast takes around 8 hours (give or take depending on how many lbs) on low. Depending on what kind of veggies I decide to go with, I will add those in the crockpot 30 mins-1 hour before I plan on taking everything out and serving. I have not branched out to many other types of dishes with a crockpot, but I know it can be used for soups, lasagna, oatmeal, breakfast casseroles, and even desserts, so if you don't fancy meat, then you can still enjoy the benefits of a crockpot.

Overall, if you aren't the best of cooks, you're looking for something to make meals easier or you don't have much time to devote to being in the kitchen.. the crockpot is for you.

It’s a versatile appliance that’s perfect for busy people, allowing you to prepare flavorful meals with little hands-on time. Here’s my experience with it, including both its advantages and some of the challenges I’ve encountered.

### **Design and Build**
The **Crock-Pot** comes in a variety of sizes, ranging from **2-quart to 8-quart** capacities, making it suitable for everything from individual meals to large family dinners. The design is simple, typically featuring a **removable ceramic pot** that fits into the heating base. The ceramic pot is durable and easy to clean, either by hand or in the dishwasher.

The **lid** is usually made of glass, which is great because you can see how your meal is progressing without having to lift it and release heat. The design is functional, though some models have **locking lids** for spill-proof portability, which is helpful if you need to transport your dish to a potluck or event.

### **Ease of Use**
The main selling point of the Crock-Pot is how easy it is to use. Most models feature **low, high, and warm settings**, allowing you to adjust the temperature based on the recipe or how quickly you want your meal to cook.

You simply **add your ingredients, set the temperature**, and walk away. The slow cooking process ensures that flavors develop over time, resulting in rich, tender dishes like soups, stews, and roasts. It’s great for people with busy schedules—you can start a meal in the morning and come home to a fully cooked dinner.

### **Cooking Performance**
The Crock-Pot excels at cooking dishes that require **low and slow heat**. It’s ideal for:
- **Stews and soups**: The long cooking time allows flavors to blend beautifully.
- **Meats**: Cuts like pork shoulder, beef brisket, and chicken thighs come out incredibly tender after being slow-cooked for several hours.
- **One-pot meals**: You can throw in vegetables, protein, and broth for a hearty meal with minimal cleanup.

The **low and slow** cooking process also makes it perfect for **meal prep**. You can make large batches of food, divide them into portions, and refrigerate or freeze them for later use.

### **Challenges and Considerations**
- **Lack of Browning**: One of the main drawbacks of using a Crock-Pot is that it doesn’t **brown meats**. If you want a deep, rich flavor from caramelized meat or vegetables, you’ll need to sear them in a separate pan before adding them to the Crock-Pot. This adds an extra step to the cooking process, which can be a bit inconvenient, especially if you’re looking for a true one-pot solution.

- **Long Cooking Times**: While the Crock-Pot is designed for long, slow cooking, the downside is that it’s not ideal for **quick meals**. If you realize at the last minute that you need to make dinner, the Crock-Pot won’t be much help unless you have hours to spare.

- **Overcooking**: Though the Crock-Pot is designed to slowly cook your meals over several hours, it’s possible to **overcook** certain foods, particularly vegetables like peas and zucchini that become mushy if left in too long. Meat, on the other hand, tends to fare better, but you still need to watch cooking times to avoid overcooked or dry textures.

- **Cleaning the Pot**: While the ceramic insert is dishwasher safe, it can be **heavy and cumbersome** to clean if you’re washing it by hand, especially when there’s food stuck to the bottom. Some models come with **non-stick surfaces**, which are easier to clean but can scratch over time.

- **Bulky**: Depending on the size, Crock-Pots can be **bulky** and take up a lot of counter or storage space. If you have a small kitchen, this might be something to consider, especially if you don’t plan on using it frequently.

### **Energy Efficiency**
One of the benefits of the Crock-Pot is that it’s relatively **energy efficient** compared to using a traditional oven or stovetop for long periods. It uses a lower wattage and heats slowly, which can result in energy savings if you’re cooking meals that take several hours.

### **Pros**
- **Hands-off cooking**: Once your ingredients are in, you can walk away and come back to a fully cooked meal.
- **Versatile**: Perfect for soups, stews, meats, and even desserts.
- **Tender, flavorful results**: Slow cooking enhances flavor and makes even tough cuts of meat tender.
- **Convenient for meal prep**: Ideal for making large batches of food with minimal effort.

### **Cons**
- **No browning**: You need to brown meat separately for certain dishes.
- **Long cooking time**: Not ideal for last-minute meals.
- **Can overcook vegetables**: Some vegetables get too soft if cooked too long.
- **Bulky**: Takes up a lot of counter or storage space.

### **Final Thoughts**
The **Crock-Pot** is a fantastic kitchen tool for anyone who enjoys low-maintenance cooking, especially for meals that benefit from slow, gradual heat. It’s ideal for people with busy schedules who want to come home to a ready-made meal. However, it does have its limitations—like the need for browning meat separately and the potential for overcooking delicate vegetables. Despite these minor drawbacks, I find the convenience and versatility make it a worthwhile investment for any kitchen.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SWQ53WOQDJ8K,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B003OAJGJO,2024-09-18,29.0,positive,"['great', 'versatile', 'perfect', 'durable']",0.9983,kitchen

5⭐️- EXCEEDS MY EXPECTATIONS!
TOP QUALITY & MUST HAVE.

I’m happy that I chose the Artisan Design Series mixer. I had a Classic Series, and it was heartbreaking when it gave out. I received it as a Wedding Shower gift in 1996, and it died in February 2024—28 years of birthday cakes, cupcakes, and everything else. I had recently started making macarons to send to friends and families. It is challenging to make macarons because mixing has to be exact. Too much or too little mixing and the batch is no good. That is how I knew my Classic Series wasn’t working anymore. Once I got this new mixer, the macaron shells were perfect. The filling mixed smoothly, which made it easy to put the macarons together precisely. I provided pictures to show just how well they turned out.

Regarding the price, yes, I paid more for my favorite color. I was willing to do that because my Classic Series lasted 28 years, making it worth it. I hope this new mixer is made with the same excellence as the older series. I will be beyond disappointed if it isn’t, and it is just like everything else that breaks, and we always hear, “They just don’t make things like they used to.”

I’m going to be optimistic and go for 30 years this time. 🤣 that means I’ll be 80 and don't need a new one.

As always, I prefer to give credit where credit is due rather than short change a product, but just keep in mind there are a few drawbacks to this mixer.  But first the pros, this sucker is STURDY! Most of us have seen these mixers everywhere for what seems to be decades, but it was probably just me that didn't realize all kitchenmaid stand mixers aren't created equal.  While they may look alike, different models have different capacities, speeds and effectiveness in various applications.  I really wanted to wait to write this review until I had really explored this machine because it's such a big investment (in my opinion at least!).  Now that I have, the sturdiness of this product has definitely proven to be true.  We have a rather small kitchen and so it gets moved around quite a bit, this hasn't resulted in any sort of loosening or wiggling which is important when you have that dough hook running at top speed (some of the cheaper mixers act like poorly balanced washing machines).  The sturdiness, however, can be a double edged sword due to the heft.  If you have trouble lifting things or perhaps a bit of arthritis be sure to store this on a mobile kitchen cart or simply give it a permanent countertop space to avoid having to lift it from a bottom (or worse-top) cabinet which can be a task.  Next is function, I cannot tell you how nice it is to be able to toss something into this mixer and walk away to get the other ingredients without having to babysit a bowl! Especially when I'm working with something dense like honey or doughs. The attachments have all been easy to put on/take off and are sized well enough to store away easily.  There is room for improvement though, the rubber spatula sided mixer attachment is sold separately which is what can scrape down the sides of your bowl without you having to angle a separate spatula into the mixer, I would have been open to forgoing some of the other attachments in order to have this one right off the bat, but they are cheaper and easy to find at TJ Maxx, Marshalls, etc..  Also, the swing back mechanism for the top of the mixer via the hinge at the neck has no protection against it flipping up and down hard.  Think about the drawer add-ons you can install so they don't slam, that would be great for the head of this mixer, just to protect the hinge. Color-wise, the blue color of this mixer is absolutely dreamy! It's beautiful and a bit novel without being overly kitschy and is still easy to match to other kitchen products out there.  Overall, I really do love this piece of equipment and think it is a great investment for anyone who likes to cook or bake. This model and size is great for families and even sturdy enough to teach the little ones on. Half star loss for the lack of slow-down mechanism for the head and the lack of spatula on the mixer attachment leaving you to clean up the walls of the bowl pretty frequently, but apart from that this machine is fantastic.

PROS: Built To Last, BEAUTIFUL color, Easy On/Off Attachments, Does Not Slow Down When Dealing With Thick/Difficult Foods (i.e. Honey, Doughs, etc.), Great Size, Good Investment Piece (I bought this two years ago and the price hasn't fallen).
CONS: No Cushion For Mixer Head When Lifting up/Down To Prevent Hard Slam, Spatula Mixer Attachment Not Included Requiring You to Scrape Down The Bowl Pretty Often, Expensive (but again, it's not bad for an investment piece-I can't see this thing breaking any time soon or ever maybe)
TIPS: TJ Maxx and Marshalls have attachment for these mixers on sale regularly for 60% off the selling price so if you have one nearby go and check for that spatula attachment or even a pasta maker or meat grinder I've seen them all there!, If you are working with dough (or especially if a young one is learning) watch out for it coiling up your dough hook and into the gears-it can happen quickly if you're not careful.  Last, I've found that a metal blemish extractor (bought and dedicated for mixer cleaning) is the best tool to get into the attachment holder and metal pieces in the head of the mixer in case they get dirty (or gunked up with aforementioned dough... ).  It is sturdier than a toothpick which runs the risk of breaking and getting caught in the gears.

Firstly, the quality of the cheesecloth is top-notch. It's made of unbleached pure cotton and is both lint-free and ultra-fine mesh, which I believe played a crucial role in the even cooking and basting of my turkey. The cloth is reusable and washable, which is a huge plus for me, as I prefer sustainable kitchen tools.

The size of the cloth (1 yard) was more than adequate for my large turkey. It was easy to drape over and tuck around the bird, ensuring that every part was evenly covered. What impressed me most was how the cheesecloth held up during the cooking process. It didn't tear or disintegrate, which has been my experience with lesser-quality cloths in the past.

One of the best features is the hemmed edges – no fraying means I can use this cloth repeatedly without worrying about little threads getting into my food. It's a small detail, but it makes a big difference in the kitchen.

Using the Julia Child technique, the cheesecloth helped keep the turkey moist and flavorful, leading to a juicy, tender bird that was the star of our Thanksgiving dinner. The flavors were locked in, and the skin turned out perfectly browned and crispy. My family couldn't stop raving about how good and yummy the turkey was!

Exceeded my expectations. It's a simple tool, but it made a significant impact on my Thanksgiving cooking. I highly recommend it to any home cook looking for a reliable, high-quality cheesecloth, especially for special occasions.

Instructions are simple and easy to follow; however, a helpful note to add might be to make sure the display is completely cleared by closing the probe and reopening before starting the calibration process. It took me a few tries after I was playing with the “hold, max, min” feature. Only when I cleared it was I able to calibrate it. I like that it’s magnetized, which I found out by surprise when it stuck to my gas grill while barbecuing. I have not used this thermometer for candy making yet so I’m hopeful that it works as described. If it does, that’ll save me money by not having to buy a separate one like we’re being led to believe is a must. Just because the probe is shorter than the 8”-10” candy thermometer does not mean you can’t use it for that purpose. Only the tip needs to be submersed.

Ok, so it was on an end cap and my son wanted it so I said ok. I liked it so much I bought this one here.
First of all, before I was using other brands for his water bottle at school. Sippy cups, NUK brand, that one made from recycled plastic, anything. Usually plastic and typically see through. That stops NOW (for him taking to school, I'm not throwing the others out---yet).
First of all, I forgot what made a Thermos great: the insulation. This kid will have his water bottle with ice full at night, and still have ice in the morning. I know when he goes to school his water will stay COLD (it isn't for hot drinks).
Second of all, it is durable. Toddler durable. Toddler winging it across a parking lot as they are swinging around telling you a story about Paw-Patrol durable. Sure there may be some surface scrapes, but deep down it's ok. And so are you.
This thing is so easy to clean in a dishwasher or by hand. Some sippy cups it feels like you are a EOD expert taking apart and assembling the pieces. Not this guy, pop off the lid, pop off the straw, pop off the mouth piece and clean.
Leak proof? Pretty much so, unless you don't screw it on properly. If the lid/mouthpiece is open, yea it leaks, but so do most things when the lids are open.
Am I worried about lingering odors? My kid loves water. Like, legit, it's his favorite. We only use this for water so there are no odors.
Am I worried about his orthodontic growth due to the impact sippy cups have on his forming teeth? No, is this a new thing? I just want my kid hydrated and not chugging sugar all day.
Does it hurt when you drop it on your toe? Oh, you betcha.

Mostly for pancakes (5 boys) but also for a variety of other foods.  obviously with a large family we need a large griddle - and we don't want to pull a giant cast iron griddle down and cover the stove so we picked up this electric griddle.

*COOKING*
it cooks 'OK'.
TEMP Control: unless you have a infrared thermometer you're not going to get a precise temperature.  not a lot of fidelity on the small dial - but most griddles i've ever known in the last 40 years are like that.
EVEN Heating?  No - the aluminum is so thin that even on low temperatures or after pre-heating you're going to get a band of hot around the outside and a much cooler inside.

**CLEANING**
the surface has held up well - and with a tiny bit of butter wiped on the surface between pancake rounds it works great.  however just like nearly all of the griddles out there you'll find that food and gunk get caught in the handles and places where it is very hard to clean - so minus one star there.

**BUILD**
why is the metal so thin?  this is disappointing for so many griddles out there.  if you put any cool/cold foods on this the heat is immediately sapped and the griddle takes a while to come back to temp.  Also after only 18 months the griddle has warped with the middle of the griddle lower than the sides (ok - maybe only a 1/8 inch but it is noticeable).  Since we store it vertically with nothing on it i surmise that this is just from the heating and cooling.

**SIZE**
Yup - its pretty big.  i like big.  i'd like bigger - but this is about as big as you get without buying a commercial kitchen.  you can do 8 medium size pancakes if you're careful - i generally do 6 larger well spaced cakes.

overall this griddle is just fine.  am i enamored?  no.  but for the price it works.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JD9TA7USZDT5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0779PK6SH,2023-12-22,62.0,positive,['great'],0.9643,kitchen

Pros:
- When it first warms up, the heat is pretty distributed
- Fairly non-stick, and what does stick comes up pretty easy
- Large surface area to work
Cons:
- Almost too non-stick - would be better with slightly higher edges, since the food may slide to the little lip and fall right off
- After the intitial warm up, it only cooks food that are over the element
- Much like stainless steel, if the cook top is not hot enough, food sticks (which I think is normal for ceramic)

This is actually my second purchase of this torch because I was pretty impressed with it the first time around. However, my experience this time hasn't been as great.

When I first bought the Sondiko Butane Torch, it worked like a charm for a few months. The flame it produced was intense and powerful, exactly what I needed for all sorts of tasks. Plus, the tank size was just right, allowing me to use it for longer periods without having to refill frequently. These were the main reasons I decided to give it another go.

Unfortunately, this time around, I faced a disappointing issue. After just a few uses, the lock feature decided to stop working. It was frustrating because I couldn't get the torch to lock properly, which made it a bit tricky to handle. Safety concerns aside, it was a real downer and affected my overall satisfaction with the product.

On the positive side, when the torch did work, the flame intensity was still impressive. It produced the same level of heat as my previous purchase, which was perfect for tasks that required precision and high temperatures. And the tank size remained ample, allowing me to use the torch for extended periods without interruptions.

But here's the thing: the fact that the lock feature failed after just a couple of uses is a major drawback. It raises questions about the torch's durability and reliability. And what's more frustrating is that this isn't the first time I've experienced this issue. It makes me wonder if there's a flaw in the design or manufacturing process that needs to be addressed.

To sum it up, while the Sondiko Butane Torch initially impressed me with its intense flame and decent tank size, my overall satisfaction was hampered by the recurring lock issue. It's hard to ignore the torch's questionable durability, as it failed to last beyond a few months on my first purchase and less than a month on my second. I really hope the manufacturer takes note of this flaw and works on improving it in future versions of the product. We all deserve a reliable and long-lasting torch, after all.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX467V6UQ7UO2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d891ed43-2b11-4c43-9772-c26a670a7905._CR0,0,400,400_SX48_.jpg",True,B07L8YPYQK,2023-07-08,39.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.7203,kitchen

It would be great for application that requires fine control like creme brullee.
For application like steaks that requires heat over large surface, the torch fails.

It took me ages to sear my tenderloin with the torch
Result was good since flame is hot enough, but area it covers is just too small and took way longer than I would have liked.

Another big downside for me is that I can't attach a gas can to the torch. I have to refill gas into the tiny tank inside the torch. I planned to use the torch quite often, but I can foresee myself being interrupted time and again to refill the torch.

If you plan to use the torch for small and price application, put it on your list.

The Farberware option in Aqua was more expensive than a knock off in red so I went with the knockoff. It wasn't in my house 5 minutes before it got returned because it had sharp rough edges that would have scratched my non-stick cookware. So I went ahead and spent more to buy the Farberware aqua model and I am so pleased.
