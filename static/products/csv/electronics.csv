0,1,B0D1XD1ZV3,"Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds, Active Noise Cancellation, Hearing Aid Feature, Bluetooth Headphones, Transparency, Per",$169.99,4.6,10774,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SUj2aKoEL._AC_UL900_SR900,600_.jpg",2820,11449,RB47WOU0Q32Y5,"AirPods Pro 2: Subtle Upgrades, Major Impact for Everyday Users","I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years‚Äîstandard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I‚Äôm glad I did. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed after using them.

The biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it's in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2‚Äôs ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There‚Äôs also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn‚Äôt in the first version. It‚Äôs made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.

In terms of sound, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you‚Äôre really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.

One of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I‚Äôm getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable‚Äîno more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.

Something I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I‚Äôm happy to report that it‚Äôs still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful‚Äîsomething the previous model didn‚Äôt offer, which was a frustrating limitation.

AppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they‚Äôve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don‚Äôt have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you're covered from day one.

For me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you‚Äôre like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you‚Äôre not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that‚Äôs likely coming soon.

In conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it's definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB47WOU0Q32Y5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/24eff174-2462-428d-a5b4-22497ef5d2c0._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",True,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-09-27,793.0,positive,['life'],0.9955,electronics

You made a great pair of headphones.

My favorite feature is the head movement to answer or deny a call. I am not sure how they achieved this but I am very happy with it to be honest.

I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.

The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.

The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.

I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.

As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. I have noticed recently how good the sound quality is. It‚Äôs stunning. Sometimes I still prefer my Maxes for certain listening experiences or if I‚Äôm heavily invested in a movie or I have a long flight, but the quality on the 2nd gen pros is so crisp. Some pitches you can notice are superior to that of the Maxes. In terms of listen, Maxes win, but it‚Äôs so damn close. AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, discrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.

The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.

Long story short, if you‚Äôre on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.

Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3H55DLDY8DCXL,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-08-09,1.0,positive,"['great', 'useful', 'love', 'durable']",0.9992,electronics
3,1,B0D1XD1ZV3,"Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds, Active Noise Cancellation, Hearing Aid Feature, Bluetooth Headphones, Transparency, Per",$169.99,4.6,10774,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61SUj2aKoEL._AC_UL900_SR900,600_.jpg",2820,11449,R26UEFEPMZFOEW,These are fantastic! First pair of AirPods. I use the hearing aid functionality,"A couple months ago I got ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù hearing aids from the VA. However, I didn‚Äôt like how they operated so I gave them back, and they‚Äôre going to order a different brand/model, which I‚Äôll have in about three months (!) So I went in search of quality, inexpensive hearing aids to fill the gap. (My hearing loss is considered mild, at -32db on one side and -39db on the other.) I got the AirPods last Friday, and the software for hearing aid support rolled out last night (iOS 18.1) So this will be a two part review.

Part one is the overall operation as earbuds for music and calls. These are my first ever Apple branded sound devices. Once I got the correct tips installed and the buds fitted, I was ready to go. OMG! The sound quality overall is the best of any earbuds I‚Äôve ever owned, and by a huge margin. Astonishing bass, and crisp high range. (My hearing loss is in the upper ranges.) I‚Äôm beyond happy. Overall, the only thing I‚Äôm dissatisfied with is the battery life at 5-6 hours, but the extremely fast recharge speed eases that compliant. Voice quality when on a call is crystal clear. Controls are easy, though a bit hard to operate considering how small they are.

Part two is the hearing aid function. The first thing I had to do was take a hearing test with the included software. (However, if you prefer to use a third party hearing test, you can import that profile and use it.) The hearing test takes about 5 minutes, after which the hearing aid sound enhancement profile is set automatically and they start up. I was totally gobsmacked at how well these things work! They boost the exact freqs I need. They actually work considerably better than those $7000 (egads!) hearing aids that I returned.

Now for the ANC. At home, I sit right in front of a large, noisy window air conditioner. On the opposite side of the room is a dehumidifier (I live in south central Texas, where it was 91¬∞ yesterday.) Between these two pieces of equipment, it‚Äôs pretty noisy here. I turned on ANC and the room went absolutely silent. So silent that I thought I‚Äôd popped a circuit breaker and everything had stopped running. I removed one of the AirPods, and the noise returned. Amazing.

In short, everything I‚Äôd hoped the commercial hearing aids would do, the AirPods actually DID. I consider this the smartest purchase I‚Äôve made in years. Only one negative, and that‚Äôs the ear tips. None of the provided sizes are a good fit for me, so I‚Äôm now looking to memory foam replacements. But that‚Äôs a very small gripe. If you‚Äôre looking at these, either for music or hearing, don‚Äôt hesitate. You‚Äôll be glad you got them.

EDIT: I had to go to a doctor appointment across town today. Part of the route is on a toll highway with an 80 mph speed limit and heavy traffic. I got up to speed and turned on noise cancel mode.  INSTANTLY the car was completely silent at 80 mph. No road rumble, no engine noise, no wind noise, no traffic noise. It was an amazing and invigorating experience.  Oh, for those wondering about recharge time, if you take them all the way down to 0% battery and they shut down (I‚Äôve now ascertained that 6 hours is about what you get with all the options turned on), it only takes about 15 minutes in the charge case and you‚Äôll easily get another 3-4 hours out of them.

EDIT2: Okay, I‚Äôve had these for almost a month, and I just keep liking them more and more. I didn‚Äôt mention pairing in my original text above, so I need to mention it here. There is, in effect, no pairing that you need to do, at least in the Apple-verse. By the time I‚Äôd opened the charging case and looked at the buds, they‚Äôd already paired with both my iPhone and iPad. I didn‚Äôt have to go into settings on my iOS devices, or press any buttons on the case. Just open case and it‚Äôs done. As a computer engineer for 40 years, I have never seen a faster or more seamless pairing of anything.

One more word on recharging: just today I took them all the way to zero. Dropped them in the charger and in FIVE MINUTES they were at 24%.

I am in love with the hearing aid functionality. I hear sounds in movies that I‚Äôd never heard before in my life, even when my hearing was perfect. And I can adjust amplification either by going into settings on my iPhone, or sliding my finger up or down on the stem.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26UEFEPMZFOEW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-10-29,327.0,positive,"['amazing', 'life', 'perfect', 'love']",0.9968,electronics

I‚Äôve never written a review but I had to because of how magnificent these are. The noice cancelling is amazing, for my first test I sat in a chair playing loud music turned away from a piano. I sat and waited, then took one out to tell her to start playing. To my astonishment she had been playing for a while and I didn‚Äôt even notice. The transparency mode is amazing as well because you‚Äôll often forget there even in your ears because it plays the sound so well. You can even hear the slightest brush of your fingers it‚Äôs like there not even in. They are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly in your ears. They hardly weigh anything but they still have amazing battery life. They are extremely durable and water resistant as well. I had one in my pocket and as I went to get the mail it fell out. An hour later after searching and searching I found it in the road in the snow with tire tracks right over it practically burying it. It took it home thinking it would be completely ruined, but besides worse noice cancelling and a big scratch on the side (which is only cosmetic damage) it works perfectly. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the audio quality. I have high quality head phones and these AirPods Pro 2 blow them out of the water and they are extremely portable. The precision find my is also so nice because it also doubles as an AirTag. I put them on my keys and haven‚Äôt lost them since. Seriously the best product I‚Äôve ever purchased because I use them hours daily. The only possible downside I could even think of is if you have very large ears, they may not fit great since the tips only go to extra large. Also don‚Äôt buy apple care plus. It‚Äôs a scam because they are literally indestructible and impossible to lose. Best $250 dollars ever spent would give 10 stars if possible. Seriously besides my phone, which I use to connect with my AirPods, there is nothing I use more than these AirPod pros. Also I exercise in them all the time and unless intentionally trying to knock them out, they‚Äôve never fallen out. Oh yeah and also they are perfect for taking calls as well. And they fit perfectly into the overpriced apple ecosystem.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TJTYKID5K0C,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-11-27,5.0,positive,"['perfect', 'amazing', 'great', 'life', 'durable']",0.9978,electronics

When Apple announced the addition of hearing aids features, I thought it was a good excuse to upgrade. And it would be one less lightning connector I'd have to contend with. This review is written for those of you who are considering upgrading.

I bought these prior to the release of iOS 18.1. The setup was the same as before, find comfortable rubbers, run the test that plays the little tune and that's it. With iOS 18.0 the sound didn't seem much better over Gen 1 AirPods Pro, but the noise cancellation was an improvement. However, with the update to 18.1 there's a big change. There's now a hearing assistance screen where you toggle on hearing aids. You're prompted to take a hearing test. This test is similar to hearing tests you might have had in school or at a doctors' office where tones of differing pitch and loudness are played and you tap a button on the screen when you hear it. It takes about 10 minutes or so. The phone/earbuds then produce a profile based on your test results. You can also take the report to an audiologist (the report is in the Health app), although I'm not all that sure they'd bother to review it.

Once you've done a hearing test the hearing aid is enabled. You can then make adjustments to the default settings. I found the default setting to have far too much high end for my liking and too much gain as well. But then again maybe I'm just used to being half-deaf. üòâ I did discover I have a device with a bad fan though, so maybe that's a good thing. I don't seem to get any squealing or feedback when using the hearing aid feature but I've only used it a few times. It did come in handy when at a meeting with a quiet talker speaking, boosting up the sound made it much easier to listen. But ultimately I'd say the hearing aid function is a gimmick. If you're really worried about hearing loss, go to an audiologist.

However, there is one thing that going through the hearing test and setting up hearing assistance does improve and that's the playback of music. Because it is able to adjust EQ to match your hearing profile there's a drastic improvement in how good the AirPods sound. I'd put them on par with my Bose QC-3 headset now, maybe even slightly better (Bose still has much better noise cancellation of course). Adaptive noise cancellation works but tends to be little too aggressive, so I just use full cancellation. The personalized volume and conversation awareness functions are also a little too touchy and seem to be constantly changing the volume control in response to false alarms. I'm sure they'll get better over time but for now I wouldn't say they're a reason to switch.

They also have the same problems connecting to whatever random device happens to grab them. I work out with my Watch but leave my phone at home. So if I start playing a podcast or music in my driveway it will originate from my iPhone, even if I'm using my watch to initiate the media. It is getting slightly better in that eventually the AirPods will abandon the iPhone then connect to the Watch (I used to have to pull them out of my ears, wait a few seconds then try to start playback on the watch), but there's still a gap of a few annoying seconds while they sort things out. Again, not the end of the world, but seems like a solvable problem.

If you're hoping to get budget hearing aids, look elsewhere. I can't imagine wearing these for 12-16 hours a day. I'm not so sure the batteries will last that long anyway. Besides, you're wearing earbuds, so people probably won't realize you're using them in hearing aid mode. And let's all admit it, they look kind of dorky.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDZLQ7XHX7K91,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-11-20,11.0,positive,[],0.7324,electronics

I have also been a cheap AirPod guy too, meaning I have always bought the basic ones and been pretty happy with them, for the most part.

 I‚Äôm a carpenter and so things get treated a bit rough with me but I have always longed for something a bit better, meaning better quality sound, maybe some noise cancelation and just a better ear bud all around. I really wanted to have that precision ‚Äúfind me app‚Äù quality that AirTags have but the older more basic air pods don‚Äôt have it. They claimed to but not once did they play a sound and not once could I find them with the find my app, these have the precision locating and also play a loud tone .. but also (see below)

Recently I ran my latest AirPods through the washer. Caught it early‚Ä¶ but honestly too late, the charging case was full of water and went directly into rice. R.I.P old ear buds.  They didn‚Äôt make it , let‚Äôs have a moment of silence for them plz‚Ä¶

Okay ! So the new AirPod pro 2(second gen) came and I instantly patted myself on the back for opting for the $199 upgrade just to see if all the hype was true.. it is !!

The second I put them in my ears, the entire world arround me disappeared. Silence to the point of ‚Äúis that fan off? Because normally it‚Äôs loud AF, thought me, took out the AirPods and yup it was still loud.
The noise cancellation is insanely good !!

The amazing sound quality of music is just that, amazing, and this little bundle of joy is worth its weight in gold with all of the customizable settings they offer, heck you can even take a pic of your ear and it will tell u what supplied plug covers are best suited for your ear, as well as a sound test option to make sure you are getting every cent out of these.

Now I also bought a waterproof/crush proof case, the Catalyse ones you see in pic above so we don‚Äôt have anymore washing machine accidents.

So the question still remains, is the extra $100 dollars for pro 2‚Äôs worth it ?

For me that‚Äôs a resounding yes.

Never would I opt for ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù AirPods.. nothing about that sounds appealing.

These should last me at least a couple of years, where as my old basic AirPods might have lasted 6 months. I found that the basic ones sound and stuff diminished rapidly

So ‚Äútreat yo-self‚Äù to the AirPod 2 pros, again I repeat, the second I put them in my ears, I knew I made the right decision.

My old stick still works. I believe it's worth the update every 3-5 years. I also replaced my internet provider at the same time. When I 1st used this fire stick, my network was not the one I had saved on Amazon. (I had to change or rather add the new network to save on Amazon). The setup still went very smoothly. I stream at 1080 (on a 1080p tv)  but this  is 4K ready. The interface is much the same but a few UI changes are noticeable. I can tell the new one has more processing power. Well worth what I paid for the device. I have used Apple TV, MAX, Netflix, Hulu, MGM+, and YouTube. (Prime video) and others in the 1st week. All of these work well. People claim the Fire stick is for Amazon users, but it‚Äôs a cheap and easy way to use pretty much all streaming services.

As someone who's been using streaming devices for years, I was skeptical about whether this tiny stick could live up to the hype. But let me tell you, it exceeded my expectations in every way.

First of all, the setup process was a breeze. I simply plugged it in, downloaded the app, and I was up and running in minutes. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it perfect for my non-tech-savvy family members to use as well.

The picture quality is STUNNING. Watching my favorite shows and movies in 4K is like experiencing them for the first time all over again. The colors are vibrant, the details are crisp, and the sound is crystal clear. I've watched some of my favorite movies and TV shows in 4K, and I'm blown away by how immersive the experience is.

The Alexa integration is also seamless. I love being able to control my TV with just my voice, and the Echo dot I have in my living room integrates perfectly with the Fire TV Stick. It's so convenient to be able to search for shows or play music without having to reach for the remote.

One of the things that really impressed me was the selection of apps available. Of course, all the major streaming services are there (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc.), but there are also some great indie channels and niche services that I wouldn't have expected to find on a streaming device.

The only minor complaint I have is that the remote control could be a bit more robust. Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the commands to register, and it would be nice if there were more buttons for quick access to different features (like switching between apps or adjusting volume). But overall, these are minor quibbles compared to the many benefits of this device.

I‚Äôve been using the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for a couple of weeks now, and I‚Äôm beyond impressed with the upgrades on this device. Whether you‚Äôre a streaming enthusiast or a gamer, this Fire Stick is a game-changer!

Elevated Streaming Performance:
The 4K Ultra HD picture quality is absolutely stunning, especially with Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support. It‚Äôs like having a mini theater in my living room, and the Dolby Atmos audio really adds to that cinematic experience. Everything streams smoothly, even with multiple devices connected to Wi-Fi, thanks to the built-in Wi-Fi 6 support. No buffering, just pure, uninterrupted entertainment.

Cloud Gaming at its Finest:
What really blew me away is the ability to stream Xbox games without a console! I was able to play Forza Motorsport and Starfield via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, right on my Fire Stick. For anyone who loves gaming but doesn‚Äôt want to invest in a separate console, this is a fantastic solution.

Alexa Voice Remote:
The Alexa Voice Remote is super handy‚Äîjust speak into it, and it finds your content in seconds. Plus, the preset buttons for my favorite apps (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+) save time. And yes, it controls TV power and volume too, so fewer remotes cluttering the couch!

Endless Entertainment Options:
With access to over 1.5 million movies and shows, I never run out of things to watch. The added bonus? Tons of free content through ad-supported apps like Freevee and Pluto TV. It‚Äôs perfect for binge-watching without worrying about subscription fees.

Smart Home Integration:
This device also works seamlessly with my smart home gadgets. I can control my lights, check my Ring doorbell camera, or even ask Alexa for the weather‚Äîall without leaving the couch. The convenience is unmatched.

Overall, the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is a no-brainer for anyone looking to upgrade their entertainment setup.

The picture quality of the fire stick through my projector is outstanding. I really feel like I‚Äôm in a movie theater now and I am just in my bedroom.  Once I fix the sound networking problem it will be my own personal theater.

If you have the space and lifestyle for it you get so much more bang for your buck with a projector over purchasing a TV.  I have a 120‚Äù screen with crystal clear 4K and with prime day sales I picked up my projector for $550.

First, the Alexa app is buggy about connecting to Apple Music. It isn't just a problem with the latest version because Reddit is full of threads from 2 and 4 years ago about getting error messages after logging into an Apple account from this app. Fortunately, one of those threads pointed me to a link, on the Amazon website, where I was able to link my Apple Music account the way it should be able to be linked through the Alexa app. After that, I was able to connect Apple Music to the Alexa app, and voice commands to the Dot now work fine for listening to my playlists.

Second, I had an issue using the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker to play Apple Music via AirPlay. It connects and plays the music fine, but the Dot makes extremely, ear-splitting, smoke-alarm loud announcements whenever it connects to my phone via Bluetooth. Since I was trying to use my phone in the middle of the night for ambient music to help sleep, and since this was more than loud enough to disturb my upstairs neighbors, AirPlay was a no-go. As for the previous issue, a quick search yielded years of Reddit threads about this issue, but no solutions other than to not connect any devices to the Dot via Bluetooth.

So, it was a rough first day with the Alexa app failing to connect me to the music source I subscribe to - I'm guessing it works just fine for Amazon Music - and with the Dot itself making such loud announcements if I try to use AirPlay that there is just no reasonable way for me to live with the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker. But if I block the Dot from connecting with my phone, it works great as intended - with Alexa voice commands. The sound quality is as good as you'd expect from such a tiny speaker, and exactly what I wanted for bedtime music in an apartment building - very clear sound with little bass, so that I can listen to podcasts or ambient music at 2 AM and not bother neighbors.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XTKWS0C2QORF,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B8V1LZ3,2024-10-16,38.0,positive,['great'],0.9076,electronics

Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in!

I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging.  I‚Äôm always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer.  I‚Äôm a fan of smart devices for that very reason.  I enjoy, dare I say ‚Äúrely‚Äù, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don‚Äôt have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day.  Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible.  On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen.  The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock.  For some reason my watch didn‚Äôt detect that I had fallen.  Something it had done successfully in the past.  That meant emergency services would not be alerted.  I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)‚Ä¶.I couldn‚Äôt do it.  My next thought was to try and scoot to the table.  My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this.  I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered.  I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands.  I didn‚Äôt know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip.  That‚Äôs when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone‚Ä¶.what was I going to do?  Then I remembered Dot.  I asked her to call my emergency contacts.  She did it!  Unfortunately, none heard their phones.  It‚Äôs late at night, and they were all asleep.  The pain was becoming severe and I was scared.  I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn‚Äôt do that!  I didn‚Äôt expect that.  Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex.  They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I‚Äôm disabled.  I had an emergency plan in place.  This plan had worked for me in the past.  Nothing is fool proof.  I learned the importance of having a backup plan.  Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall.  I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked.  I never imagined I‚Äôd be using my Dot for an emergency.

Got it cheap on sale, I think it was during Amazon prime day. Stuck it in the garage so I can check the ""outside"" temp before going out and to have something to play music in the garage while working out there. Sounds good playing music even at full volume.

The usual problems with Amazon devices not understanding the difference between being told to turn something ""on"" and ""off"".  If have several lights as a group and already have one of those lights on and you tell it to turn on the group it turns off the entire group instead of turning it on. Takes several tries before it turns on the lights. After a while you get used to it. You say it once and wait a little bit and if nothing happens or it turns everything off then just don't wait for the lights to change state but just repeat command several times in a row quickly and then it works. Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... and then stop once it turns the lights on. And oh yeah not to mention if told to turn on ""kitchen"" it would sometimes turn on ""fan"" instead which is the light in the living room ceiling fan.

I ordered one of these a few days ago, spent a few hours trying to set it up, consulted the internet, and nothing really worked. It continually got stuck at the ""searching for wifi"" step and being unsuccessful in finding *any* networks. I tried manually connecting it, using a mobile hotspot, restarting my router, etc etc etc. It could not find ANY signal at all. I called customer support, did a hard reset, tried some things, and still nothing. The lady recommended I return the device and order a new one, so I got a refund, returned the first unit, and ordered a new one.

I was conflicted whether I should order this same model again or try a completely different smart speaker. Ultimately I decided to give it one more shot and I received the new unit today. Plugged it in, had guarded hopes. Again, same issue that it couldn't find a network to connect to. So I shut off Bluetooth and tried manual connection again. This time, a list of networks came up! ... but not my network. So I ""added"" my network, and it would glitch and start over. I tried half a dozen times to add my network, and it still wouldn't show up or connect. I tried another hard reset for the device, and repeated adding my network again to no avail. Back to consulting the internet! I hard reset the device, and followed a guide I found on Reddit. Still, it didn't work with my wifi network, so I had the idea to download the alexa app on my tablet and use my phone hotspot instead of my wifi. I read something that if you leave the app page for ANY reason during setup (even just the device falling asleep for a second or two), the app will glitch and connection with fail. So I hard reset the device again, added device, selected the echo dot, disconnected my tablet's bluetooth, selected manual connection in the app, then connected to the Amazon ""wifi"" network, let it search for wifi, came up with a list that didn't include mine, and so I manually added my hotspot network's name and password. It did it's little loading thing, and sent me back to the searching for wifi page. The list of networks came up again and alas, it happened! My hotspot appeared on the network page! I clicked it, feeling as though Alexa were playing tricks on me but after all my failed attempts, it finally connected! .... to my hotspot, but at least there was a shred of hope somewhere in the universe that this tiny, frustrating device had some potential, if only I could just add my personal wifi network instead!

So all I had to do was spend another hour repeatedly fiddling with the app trying to add a new network so I could move it off of my hotspot to my wifi. I followed the same steps that worked for the hotspot connection (minus the hard reset) and after the third or fourth attempt, it finally connected.... And then I had to unplug it to move it to it's permanent location 10 feet away from my router- I did all this at the same outlet my router is plugged into because it was struggling so much. I considered just leaving if there for eternity because I didn't want to risk it reseting and having to deal with all the connection issues again. You have no idea the relief I felt when I plugged it into its permanent outlet and it automatically reconnected. If I had to mess with the setup process from scratch again, I probably would've just returned it again.

I don't understand how this is a 5th generation device with such a flawed and frankly crappy set up process. I had to go digging through my router settings, app settings, restarted/reset the device multiple times, rebooted my router, consulted customer support, poked around multiple online forums, and spent hours trying to get this cursed little orb functioning. That said, it is now working. We'll see how it holds up over the next few weeks. If it had so much trouble finding my wifi in the first place, I'm curious to see how it'll hold up and if it will stay connected or continue posing issues. All I know is when I move out and have to set it up again in a few years.... lord help me.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R315A2D3B5PDVB,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B8V1LZ3,2024-10-05,13.0,negative,"['hard', 'hard', 'hard', 'hard', 'hard']",-0.9747,electronics

You can definitely receive calls from other Echo devices. I‚Äôve done that with my cousin. No problem. What limits general phone redirect isn‚Äôt your phone brand, it‚Äôs your mobile provider. Only a few providers offer additional charge services that allow you to receive any mobile call via this device. Other than in this comment, you likely won‚Äôt find that out without installing and learning to navigate the Alexa app.

** I started this comment with the asterisk note because that type of notifcation is lacking from web and print info about the Echo. The quick start guide (the only user manual in print you receive) just states that a green light ring means:

You have an incoming call. Say ‚ÄúAlexa, answer the call.‚Äù

What you don‚Äôt receive in writing is any printed documentation about who can and can‚Äôt call you.

It took one replacement device and two calls to the Alexa help line for me to get a solid answer about the issue. Please understand, the Echo works well for what it should do. The problem is that information is tucked several links into an app which you may need help to navigate at all. I‚Äôm giving one star down because Amazon has made the app needlessly hard to navigate and they‚Äôve also failed to update online help information. Some important user info about the Alexa app is well out of date! For example, to get to the info I‚Äôm discussing here, you‚Äôll first need to go the Communications tab which online help will say is at the bottom of the home screen. I was told by support that it used to be on the home screen, but Amazon removed it from there. You now have to first navigate to that tab to even start trying to find incoming call access info.

I tagged my keys and my wallet.  If I walk out the door without either item, I get an alert to my phone indicating I've left the item behind.  The AirTag can then by tracked by my phone and will direct me to the precise location of the item, such as my keys or wallet.

Before AirTags? I used to search for items that fell behind the couch or that I dropped getting out of the car or credit cards (tagged wallet) that I left in the restaurant.  If my wallet were stolen, I would get a ""separation"" alert showing the location of the stolen wallet.  Of course, I would then immediately disable my credit cards.

These provide a great piece of mind in my daily hectic life.  After I bought the first one, and learned how they worked, I bought two more (with cases) for my luggage.  You can also put a tag on your dog's collar or in your child's backpack.  The uses are endless.

Here's why:

**Design and Build Quality:**
The AirTag boasts a sleek, minimalist design that blends seamlessly with everyday items. Its compact, coin-like shape is both unobtrusive and elegant, fitting easily into wallets, under keychains, or into the tiny pockets of your backpack. The build quality feels robust, with a water and dust resistance rating that ensures durability.

**Functionality:**
At its core, the AirTag is all about precision finding. Paired with your iPhone, it leverages Apple's expansive Find My network to locate your items with startling accuracy. The integration with the Find My app is intuitive, providing both sound-based proximity guidance and, when within range, precise location details down to a few feet. This precision is unparalleled, especially in crowded or cluttered environments.

**User Experience:**
Setup is a breeze, thanks to Apple's typical user-friendly interface. A simple tap, and your AirTag is ready to go. The app not only helps find your items but also lets you customize your AirTag with a unique sound, which is a delightful touch when you're in a panic.

**Privacy and Security:**
Apple has done an impressive job addressing privacy concerns. Each AirTag can be assigned to an owner, and if found by another Apple device, it will only display a message to contact you, protecting your privacy. There's also an alert system for if an AirTag that doesn't belong to you is detected moving with you, which is excellent for deterring potential misuse.

**Battery Life:**
The AirTag's replaceable battery promises up to a year of use, which is quite commendable for such a small device. The ease of battery replacement is another plus, avoiding the hassle of frequently discarding and replacing the entire unit.

**Community Features:**
The power of the Find My network can't be overstated. With millions of Apple devices contributing to the network, even if your item is far from where you last saw it, there's a good chance someone can help locate it without ever knowing they did. This community aspect significantly enhances the AirTag's effectiveness.

**Potential Downsides:**
- While incredibly useful for Apple users, the full functionality does require an iPhone. Android users might find third-party apps, but without the same level of integration.
- The range can sometimes be limited if not in a dense Apple device environment, though this is rare.

**Conclusion:**
The Apple AirTag isn't just a tracker; it's a peace of mind device. For anyone within the Apple ecosystem, it's an almost perfect solution for keeping track of your valuables. Its design, functionality, and the robust network it taps into make it a standout product in the crowded market of finders.

The smallest memory size is too small for heavy users and there is a pretty stiff upcharge for the larger configuration.  New design has reverted to the square edged design language for the body, I prefer the curved body style (ie, 8th or 9th gen) but YMMV.  I don't like the camera bump, I only need a camera for FT so the quality that can be achieved with a flush mount is fine by me - again, see 8th/9th gen iPads.  Back to a wobbly device when laid down like on my iPhone :/  No Face ID is ridiculous at this point and the fingerprint scanner being located in the power button, while fast acting, isn't as handy as when it was easier to access on the front panel.

The good?  It's an iPad!  New centered camera on the ""selfie"" cam is good for FT, no more weird angles. The speakers are now located on both ends of the device, not just one end, for much better sound quality.  USB-C!  Huzzah, it's now possible to be totally free of Apple's proprietary connectors.  Thinner bezel now that there is no home button.

Read this first!

Look for the asterisks in the text below.  Read that area first before clicking on the buy button!

My iPad 9th generation has served me well for the past few years but the battery life was beginning to suffer and the screen had a few scratches from daily use.

I could have had the battery replaced, but that seemed to average around $100 and that was a no-go, especially since I was offered just $90 on trade in so spending more just didn‚Äôt make sense.

Now Apple wants $349 for the base 64GB unit but I‚Äôve noticed that many stores have reduced the price to $299, possibly because Apple has discontinued sales of the 9th generation and supplies are starting to dry up.

So, I jumped at the chance to get a newer version.  I‚Äôve been a good boy this year and saved my money so I could afford this.

I got mine in yellow since the better half has hers in pink.  No confusing these two.

One thing you‚Äôll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimensions are not much different from the earlier generation.

However, looks can be deceiving.  The screen goes from 10.2 inches to 10.9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom.

And that begs the question, how do I close out apps without pressing that button?

The android way, that‚Äôs how. You slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them (or choose the one you want to use).

Those of you using iPhones know this procedure well.

Yet another question I‚Äôve been asked - where‚Äôs the fingerprint ID if the button is gone?

It‚Äôs now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner.

I‚Äôd love to tell you that setup was a snap but I‚Äôd be lying.

******This iPad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old iPad.  Thought I had a dud.

Called Apple and they discovered this one  was lacking updates from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing.  Since my old iPad was already on 18.1, it was trying to force apps and settings to a new iPad that couldn‚Äôt readily take it.

Mind you, Apple verified this was indeed a brand new iPad and not a refurb or customer return.  It had just been sitting around in a warehouse for nearly 2 years.

So, in short, you‚Äôll have to do updates first, and then transfer from your old iPad.

And how do you do that?

* Sign in to your Apple account.

* Instead of allowing transfer from your iCloud or other iPad, tell it you want to do things manually.

* At that point it‚Äôll do the updates as required.

* Then you reset the iPad and start over; however, once the updates are installed they stay forever.  Now transferring from either the cloud or your open iPad should be a breeze.  A two hour breeze.

Plan on plugging it in, too.  You'll suck at least 30% of your battery doing just this procedure.*****

Now back to the review.

Overall operations are not drastically different from what I could see; however, I don‚Äôt use my iPad for heavy duty artistic work nor do I play intense games.  For Joe or Jane Everyday, this iPad won‚Äôt present any significant performance changes.

How about the screen?  Looks about the same to me.

Battery life?  Improved over my old tablet only because that battery was on its way out, but only time will tell if it is substantially better.

I will give points to Apple, though, for finally going to a USB-C charger instead of the Lightning variety.  I was getting tired of lugging different chargers around.

Now comes the last question - is this iPad worth the extra cost when you can still (possibly) find iPad 9s for $100 less?

Yes and no.  Yes, if you can get this model for $299 at which point it‚Äôs just $50 more than the 9th generation, comes with a bigger screen, and uses the readily accepted USB-C charger.

No, if you have to pay full retail of $350 or so.  At that point you might want to live with the Lightning charger and button at the bottom.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JV2VX0OS4WX0,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BJLCL22Y,2024-10-30,35.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.951,electronics

I found that support the Apple way is what I have looked for in technical support.  When you setup an iPad make sure you document every field you enter - Label also.  If you enter an email name for the Account and you forget that email name you are close to saying goodby to the iPad, I did forget what email name I entered, and Apple Support was GREAT in helping me to process the unit like it came from the factory.

Remember Amazon satisfy Apple that the unit you had purchased has been reset to factory default, if you entered an email name and forget what it is then you cannot clear that out and Apple thinks you are using the unit and if you want to return the Apple unit you can't, this means you have lost your money.  Kinda simple...

Well, I could not remember the email name I used, did I write it down or setup a record in my password list.  I looked in all my trash cans for maybe a note, could not find anything.  I use a data wallet, and it has worked but you have to keep the data - I went through my last copies of the backups for the wallet and when I got back to the DATE, I received the iPad I saw an item for iPad - I made sure I had a good paper copy, loaded the current version of wallet data and started setup of iPad again.

Worth the price (on sale).,"I am a fairly heavy user of headphones and most recently have used AirPod Pro 2's.  I got the beats solo 4 on sale.

The sound is very good. The battery life is amazing. The blue color is nice. It is nice that it supports lossless audio via USB-C and also comes with both the USB-C cord and a 3.5 mm male to male cord.  They are also very light, and they charge very quickly.

They work great with Apple phones and other devices, including spatial audio. They pair easily. There isn't very much to complain about.

The only negatives that I have found so far is that it's not quite as convenient to switch between devices because it does not contain the Apple H1/H2 chip, and the clamping force of the headphones is a little too tight if you wear glasses. Hopefully that will loosen up on my particular headphones.

The lack of ANC is not a big deal. The earcups are very comfortable and they block out as much noise as a cheaper pair of ANC headphones. But, if you were looking for the sort of silence that you would receive from a more expensive pair of headphones, you probably should buy a more expensive pair of headphones.

The carrying case is nice and the headphones do fold to a fairly small size. They also seem fairly durable. The only discomfort that I have wearing them is from the clamping force; I don't know whether I have a larger small head, but I am about 6 feet tall and male. Maybe a smaller framed person would not have that difficulty.. I can wear them for a couple of hours and then it's time to give my head a rest.  I'd say for the price that I paid that is worth the trouble.

It's a common joke that beats headphones are typically found around people's necks.  I don't know whether that is true, but I can tell you that they are very comfortable around your neck. The smaller ear cups and general lightweight nature of this set of earphones make them a perfect candidate for wearing around your neck.

Finally, as a recent (and still) Apple snob, it is a little disappointing that the headphones don't know whether they are on your head or sitting on a chair, so they do not pause when you take them off.  Of course, they do not have any sort of passthrough sound capability.

If, like me, you are slightly disgusted that Apple failed to make any meaningful update to the Apple branded headphones that still cost an arm and a leg this year, these are a nice compromise, considering the price.

I saved the best for last and if you continued reading to this point, congratulations, because one of the things it is difficult to ascertain with an online purchase is microphone quality (for calls or voice recognition).  It is excellent, and the headphones sound at least as good as my AirPods Pro 2's for calls in both loud and quiet environments.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21IFUPN0YORZ9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-11-08,171.0,positive,"['perfect', 'amazing', 'great', 'life', 'durable']",0.9915,electronics

The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.

These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.

Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.

Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.

The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.

Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GA8R9KQR841V,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/dc15a77a-6df7-42ca-862a-b356d5c4b842._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-10-17,105.0,positive,"['great', 'life']",0.9958,electronics

They don‚Äôt cause any soreness during shorter listening sessions, but after 2-3 hours, you might start to feel some pressure and need to adjust them for better comfort.

One of the standout features is the seamless connectivity with my MacBook and iOS devices, making switching between them hassle-free. They also support Apple‚Äôs Spatial Audio, which enhances the listening experience, especially for music and movies designed for immersive sound.

While they don‚Äôt include active noise cancellation, which would have been a nice addition, the extended battery life more than compensates for it. I‚Äôve been impressed by how long they last on a single charge, making them reliable for long workdays or travel.

It connects and plays the music fine, but the Dot makes extremely, ear-splitting, smoke-alarm loud announcements whenever it connects to my phone via Bluetooth. Since I was trying to use my phone in the middle of the night for ambient music to help sleep, and since this was more than loud enough to disturb my upstairs neighbors, AirPlay was a no-go. As for the previous issue, a quick search yielded years of Reddit threads about this issue, but no solutions other than to not connect any devices to the Dot via Bluetooth.

So, it was a rough first day with the Alexa app failing to connect me to the music source I subscribe to - I'm guessing it works just fine for Amazon Music - and with the Dot itself making such loud announcements if I try to use AirPlay that there is just no reasonable way for me to live with the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker. But if I block the Dot from connecting with my phone, it works great as intended - with Alexa voice commands. The sound quality is as good as you'd expect from such a tiny speaker, and exactly what I wanted for bedtime music in an apartment building - very clear sound with little bass, so that I can listen to podcasts or ambient music at 2 AM and not bother neighbors.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XTKWS0C2QORF,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B8V1LZ3,2024-10-16,38.0,positive,['great'],0.9076,electronics

It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.

So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 ‚Äì aside from familiarity with the brand ‚Äì was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.

First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

Once again, Amazon comes through with flying colors with their products, helping make our homes smarter and more amazing and just better to live in!

I‚Äôm a fan of smart devices for that very reason.  I enjoy, dare I say ‚Äúrely‚Äù, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don‚Äôt have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day.  Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible.  On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen.  The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock.  For some reason my watch didn‚Äôt detect that I had fallen.  Something it had done successfully in the past.  That meant emergency services would not be alerted.  I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)‚Ä¶.I couldn‚Äôt do it.  My next thought was to try and scoot to the table.  My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this.  I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered.  I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands.  I didn‚Äôt know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip.  That‚Äôs when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone‚Ä¶.what was I going to do?  Then I remembered Dot.  I asked her to call my emergency contacts.  She did it!  Unfortunately, none heard their phones.  It‚Äôs late at night, and they were all asleep.  The pain was becoming severe and I was scared.  I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn‚Äôt do that!  I didn‚Äôt expect that.  Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex.  They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I‚Äôm disabled.  I had an emergency plan in place.  This plan had worked for me in the past.  Nothing is fool proof.  I learned the importance of having a backup plan.  Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall.  I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked.

The usual problems with Amazon devices not understanding the difference between being told to turn something ""on"" and ""off"".  If have several lights as a group and already have one of those lights on and you tell it to turn on the group it turns off the entire group instead of turning it on. Takes several tries before it turns on the lights. After a while you get used to it. You say it once and wait a little bit and if nothing happens or it turns everything off then just don't wait for the lights to change state but just repeat command several times in a row quickly and then it works. Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... and then stop once it turns the lights on.

I ordered one of these a few days ago, spent a few hours trying to set it up, consulted the internet, and nothing really worked. It continually got stuck at the ""searching for wifi"" step and being unsuccessful in finding *any* networks. I tried manually connecting it, using a mobile hotspot, restarting my router, etc etc etc. It could not find ANY signal at all. I called customer support, did a hard reset, tried some things, and still nothing. The lady recommended I return the device and order a new one, so I got a refund, returned the first unit, and ordered a new one.

I was conflicted whether I should order this same model again or try a completely different smart speaker. Ultimately I decided to give it one more shot and I received the new unit today. Plugged it in, had guarded hopes. Again, same issue that it couldn't find a network to connect to. So I shut off Bluetooth and tried manual connection again. This time, a list of networks came up! ... but not my network. So I ""added"" my network, and it would glitch and start over. I tried half a dozen times to add my network, and it still wouldn't show up or connect. I tried another hard reset for the device, and repeated adding my network again to no avail. Back to consulting the internet! I hard reset the device, and followed a guide I found on Reddit. Still, it didn't work with my wifi network, so I had the idea to download the alexa app on my tablet and use my phone hotspot instead of my wifi. I read something that if you leave the app page for ANY reason during setup (even just the device falling asleep for a second or two), the app will glitch and connection with fail. So I hard reset the device again, added device, selected the echo dot, disconnected my tablet's bluetooth, selected manual connection in the app, then connected to the Amazon ""wifi"" network, let it search for wifi, came up with a list that didn't include mine, and so I manually added my hotspot network's name and password. It did it's little loading thing, and sent me back to the searching for wifi page. The list of networks came up again and alas, it happened! My hotspot appeared on the network page! I clicked it, feeling as though Alexa were playing tricks on me but after all my failed attempts, it finally connected! .... to my hotspot, but at least there was a shred of hope somewhere in the universe that this tiny, frustrating device had some potential, if only I could just add my personal wifi network instead!

So all I had to do was spend another hour repeatedly fiddling with the app trying to add a new network so I could move it off of my hotspot to my wifi. I followed the same steps that worked for the hotspot connection (minus the hard reset) and after the third or fourth attempt, it finally connected.... And then I had to unplug it to move it to it's permanent location 10 feet away from my router- I did all this at the same outlet my router is plugged into because it was struggling so much. I considered just leaving if there for eternity because I didn't want to risk it reseting and having to deal with all the connection issues again. You have no idea the relief I felt when I plugged it into its permanent outlet and it automatically reconnected. If I had to mess with the setup process from scratch again, I probably would've just returned it again.

I don't understand how this is a 5th generation device with such a flawed and frankly crappy set up process. I had to go digging through my router settings, app settings, restarted/reset the device multiple times, rebooted my router, consulted customer support, poked around multiple online forums, and spent hours trying to get this cursed little orb functioning. That said, it is now working. We'll see how it holds up over the next few weeks. If it had so much trouble finding my wifi in the first place, I'm curious to see how it'll hold up and if it will stay connected or continue posing issues.

What you don‚Äôt receive in writing is any printed documentation about who can and can‚Äôt call you.

It took one replacement device and two calls to the Alexa help line for me to get a solid answer about the issue. Please understand, the Echo works well for what it should do. The problem is that information is tucked several links into an app which you may need help to navigate at all.

I quickly replaced it with a SkyBell which worked fine until about a year ago. It stopped consistently advising me of visitors and the microphone / speaker never really worked correctly. So I wanted to replace it with something a bit more up-to-date. My choice of brands would be something that worked with my existing smart home components and existing apps or something that wasn't going to clobber me with monthly subscription costs.

I am a legacy customer of Blink, meaning that I don't have to pay a monthly fee for cloud storage. And I have several smart plugs and light switches on TP-Link's excellent app so I pretty much decided that I would go with one of these two brands. TP-Link wanted a subscription fee, so when I saw Blink's doorbell camera at a good price, I jumped. It came the same day, so I installed it the next day.

Would it fit the current placement and cover the crude hole carved on my porch for the wires?
Would it be an easy setup and would the voltage in my 22+ year old home be sufficient?
Would it feel secure when mounted? Yes to all these questions.

The existing Sky Bell doorbell cam is pretty small and didn't protrude from the wall very much. The Blink is longer and fatter, so the mount, while secure, is a bit less solid than I would like - it seems to rock a bit when pressed hard. But the wiring was simple. Installation required that I drill one additional hole in my stucco, but it took all of 15 minutes to complete the installation job. Well, 15 minutes doesn't include:
- the time I spent undoing the mounting bracket because I put it on backwards (!) and
- the time I spent unmounting the whole doorcam to remove the sticky transparent plastic wrap that Blink puts on the cam to protect it from damage while shipping and handling. Funny - no where in the instructions did I see anything about this wrap and it's almost invisible - until  you mount it.

One pro tip - there is a funny little tool that comes in the bottom of the package that you use to open the doorbell up from the bottom when it is time to replace batteries. A) Don't throw it out as it is perfectly sized to do that job. B) It comes in mighty handy to also force the doorbell on to the mount as well. I had trouble getting the body of the doorbell onto the mount and snapping into place until I used the tool. I put my tool on top of the chime box inside the house where I will completely forget it when I need it.

In operation, The Blink door cam  works well in detecting approaching visitors and I love how it works with my existing chimes. One thing that needs work is that the app allows me to exclude areas of the camera view from motion detection. This app feature seems to work with my other Blink cameras but not with my door cam. I block out motion detection right next to my door, but it detects motion there anyway. Minor, but it should work better in this regard.

My home was built in 1897 and I don't have existing doorbell wiring or chime in the house.  So wireless doorbell that came with a chime was the way I wanted to go.  Only problem, this other brand didn't offer all the options and/or configurations I was hoping for.

Then I was introduced to Blink.  It had all the options I needed.  Granted it doesn't have its own chime, BUT....you can use the mini or Alexa as your indoor chime.  Perfect!  Had the corner mount so I could point the video doorbell camera towards the entrance to the porch.  Again, old home on a corner with a wrap around porch where the entrance to the porch was on the corner and the door was at the end of one side.  Does me no good to have the camera pointing straight ahead into the front yard.  You can mix and match all of the devices to get the optimum setup for your needs, and they all connect seamlessly.

Then I started doing my research on Blink.  Reading the reviews from customers really made me question if I should buy.  Too difficult to install.  Too difficult to set up.  Can't connect to Alexa.  Battery life a fraction of what they claim.  Cameras always disconnecting.  I'm glad I ignored the reviews, chalking up the technology issues to people just not being tech savvy.  I was right.

Installation was extremely simple.  Not a fan of the online instructions instead of a booklet, but I managed.

Sync Module, video doorbell, 3 outdoor cameras and 1 mini indoor camera connected to the Blink system with no issues.

Connecting to Alexa was equally as flawless.  Set up the Blink skill in Alexa and ""she"" immediately found all the Blink devices. Our Echo in the living room, Echo Dot in the bedroom and the indoor mini will all serve as chimes wherever we are in the house.  The Echo devices will also announce any motion detection.  We can arm and disarm the system by voice command with Alexa.  Disarm does require a voice pin code which you have to set up in the Alexa app.

Setting up and managing the devices in the blink app is fairly intuitive and straight forward.  You can adjust the motion sensitivity, set up privacy and no detection zones.  After setting up the doorbell out of the box, we would get random motion detection notifications.  After checking the clips, it had to be either vehicles passing in the street facing the door, or a flag flapping in the wind at the end of the porch where the steps are.  I shut off motion detection in the street, lowered the sensitivity slightly, but  left the flag area on, and no more false detection's.  So it was definitely not the flag tripping it.  Camera still picks up people as they come to the top of the steps and alerts us.

Video quality is pretty decent.  I'm please so far.  Haven't been able to test what the night video looks like, or the two way voice at the doorbell  yet.  Once I am able to and if there are any real issues, I will edit my review.

As far as battery life, it's too early to tell.  All the documentation I have read indicates that with the sync module and turning off settings or features you don't really need will extend the battery life to the 2 years claimed.  Time will tell.

If I had a complaint so far, it's the fact that the time it takes from notification until a live view of the camera finally comes up in the app, the person tripping the motion detection has dropped off the package and left.  That timing needs reduced greatly.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCUB5S8R0X2Z,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B08SG2MS3V,2023-12-31,350.0,positive,"['life', 'perfect']",0.9448,electronics

I have tried to use regular batteries but they die in half the time. With lithium I get about 3 weeks to a month depending on my neighbors activities but with the regular ones I get one to two weeks max.

Getting this product up and running was a breeze and it's working perfectly.

IMPORTANT - If you DON'T want to pay for a subscription ($3 for a single camera), get the Sync Module 2 with an outlet wall mount and get a USB thumb drive.  This keeps your videos local and speeds up the entire service.  It also saves a lot of battery power.  Completely worth it!

For those in an apartment, I'd recommend also getting the Full Metal Blink Doorbell Mount, allowing you to install your video doorbell with drilling holes.  Definitely worth it!

Its not the one your thinking either!,"I have never such an indebt review, but I spent a whole year going through doorbells. I will start from the beginning of my experience. I will list the 3 main doorbells I bought, Why I bought them, what I didn't like about them and why I returned them and the refund process.

This is what I was looking for in a doorbell. Also, I learned through out the process what was more important for my needs. It needed to be Wireless for easy insulation. Good night vision. Good AI detection, a separate chime for indoor, remote monitoring, a long lasting battery, Elderly friendly & easy to use, and one of the most important needs were budget. I didn't want to spend a big amount on the doorbell, Then, spend money on a app, cloud subscription, separate chime, & Alexa. I was buying these for my grandparents. They do not understand having subscriptions for everything nowadays, but has to be easy to understand and use.

EKEN wireless doorbell and Chime; Bought on February 13, 2023. The reasons I bought it were, said it was free and no subscription, indoor chime, and the price. After buying this one I really learned what was important and if things seem to good to be true they probably are, duh right. First off, the app is free to downloads but is not free after that. There is a monthly app fee and cloud storage free. Also, the app is a Chinese app. its complicating and not user friendly. I got notifications every time a car went by. it was annoying. I only could see the street. It didn't show any of my drive but the very end. Only worked with 2.4 Wi-Fi. You could only have one indoor chime connected and it was not loud enough. One of my most annoying facts about this doorbell was I had to charge it every week! I live in rural area and I couldn't imagine how soon I would have to charge living in the city.  I returned EKEN on September 19, 2023 because it quit working. It would no longer connect to the internet or the chime. it was frozen for weeks. In the end I'm glad it gave out because it was really more of a nightmare and not free like they say! I paid $46 for this doorbell.

Blink Wired/Wireless Doorbell; Bought on July 31, 2023. I really had high hopes for this one. This one was the most misleading, very vague information, and the hardest to get a refund on. This is not a wireless Doorbell. For it to really work with out an Alexa, google home or some kind of in home system you have to wire it. There is no indoor Chime. You are not told about  Sync Module when buying. The app is free but cloud storage is not and you need locally storage with the Sync Module 2 and USB drive (each sold separately). I was not aware of this when I bought it. However, with out an Alexa I couldn't even get it set up and use it and get the local storage later. I thought we could use the app like every other doorbell but with out the Alexa you will get no notifications. It doesn't say when I returned it, but I remember them telling me after a non-pleasant- conversation to keep the product and we will refund you. If you are wondering... no, you can not take it home and hook it up to your Alexa. they disable it unfortunately , üòíü§£. I paid $60 for this.

Eufy Security, Battery Video Doorbell C210 Kit, Wi-Fi Connectivity, 1080p, 120-Day Battery, No Subscription, AI Detection, Wireless Chime Included, 2-Way Audio, Remote Monitoring for Apartment Living; Bought on November 5, 2023. I waited till the doorbell died for the first time to write the review. after the first one it was really important to me for it to have a reasonable length in a battery! I charged it for the first time for a good amount of time. The first's charge is always the most important on any battery powered electronics. It died on 2/15/24. The battery lasted 100 days with moderately amount of use. I am very happy with it. It does not take long to charge back up either. I am not getting a notification every time a car goes by either. The AI in the doorbell works really well on telling me when someone is here or when there is activity. Great night vision. One of my Favorite is it came with a free angle piece! so I see my whole driveway and street. The house is a normal ranch house so the driveway is 'normally' placed üòÇ none of the other doorbells came with a angle piece and the insulation looks great. There is a piece it snaps in-to, so, no thief can run off with it and protects it from water. Moreover, ITs free! The app is free and the chime is also a storage device! The chime is loud and has more then one chime. I did have to buy a memory card for the storage. In the reviews I read it said It has to be SanDisk 128GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1, Micro SD Card - SDSQUA4-128G-GN6MA. You can have a lower GB but nothing higher then 128GB. I have had no problems with it  its just a basic memory card but works great with doorbell. I have had no problems with doorbell or local storage and chime. The app is super elderly friendly and easy to use. the company brags about being budget friendly. Eufy says, ""No Subscription Required: Designed to protect your home as well as your wallet, Eufy security products are one-time purchases that combine security with convenience."" I have no complaints with this product. I had to spend more money with this one but because I don't have to pay for a subscription, app fee, and cloud storage (storage is after the moment of doorbell going off being able to see it) I paid $99.99 with a $20 coupon. The memory card was $13.88. With doorbell and everything included, memory card, and coupon & tax; I paid $100.91.

Awhile back I decided to go with amazon, mostly because the non-internet version (hubitat) I settled with was too involved a process to set up, and required more attention. I'm gone alot, and have a truckload of things to do when I get home, so I literally don't have the time to mess with something like that. Enter Alexa's repertoire of things I can utilize. Since I'm already subscribed to pretty much everything amazon has, may as well just go all in, right?
Anyhow, item came in a day early (surprising, since I live in the middle of nowhere) along with my tp-link mesh system. Pretty much doing a tech overhaul at my house. Got rid of Starlink (great service, but support sucks in general) since spectrum entered into the area and signed up with them. Starlink uses just a single wireless router if you don't want to spend more $ for additional hardware. And then there's other issues I just didn't want to subject myself. I digress.... Set up the mesh system, got spectrum running, and started connecting things.
First thing was the doorbell. This to me is still a novel thing. Yes I know its been around for awhile now, but remember, i'm doing a tech overhaul here. Didn't bother with such things before, nor cared too much about em. So, after some thinking, I installed it at the traditional place (front door), and used the wedge to angle it a bit to catch the front sidewalk. Connected it to the mesh system (took a minute, as I was unfamiliar with the system). It pretty much installs itself. It's all run off the phone as far as configuring and whatnot. You WILL be required to install the blink app. It's not part of the amazon app. Not sure why, ask Jeff about that one. Sync module is a no brainer, just follow the directions.
Here's the interesting part. I don't need yet another subscription, so I opted out of the cloud storage thing. With the app, you can pull clips off the sync module using your phone, and do whatever you want with them anyhow, don't need a sub to get it. Save yourself a few dollars and go the route I went. Get a usb stick. HOWEVER, I didn't get a usb stick just for the sync module. I have a microsd storage card (350 gig) from my previous phone that I couldn't use in my new one (fold 5), so it just sat around being randomly used as a transfer tool between pc's. So why not use it as storage for the module? Well, I plugged it into a sd card multireader and stuck it into the module... AND IT WORKS. Amazon states max is 250, but I've got an extra 100 gigs with my microsd card :)
Will tech support help if it breaks down? Doubt it. The research I did says that although higher capacity cards may or may not work in the module, support is limited to cards with a max of 250 gigs. Not sure how that works out, but I don't write software so whatever.
Long story short, camera works great. Fiddle with the sensitivity though. I set it too high (lvl 7) and got alerts from the clouds going by.  Dropped it to 6, but its too dark to tell if that helped. In the end, i'm happy with my purchase. Quality is great, and does what it says it's supposed to do.

My battery on my doorbell was low. I believe I‚Äôve have this for 2-3 months so I guess that pretty decent but!! The battery may not last that long if you are always peeping/talking through it at all or most times there is motion or if the setting are set to where it‚Äôll drain the battery more. Anywho, the batteries were apparently low or dead. The doorbell wouldn‚Äôt record motion all the time and at a certain point it just stopped working. It was acting weird for about 2-3 days recording maybe 2/10 times there was motion but the app said it was online and the battery life was ‚Äúok‚Äù. It says ‚Äúonline‚Äù even though the camera was nkt operating at all. It wasn‚Äôt ringing when. I pressed the button nor was it detecting or recording anything. I thought something was wrong with it because the app didn‚Äôt reflect what the real issue was which was literally just dead or dying batteries apparently.

You need the sync module 2($34.99 does not include storage you‚Äôll have to buy a usb storage drive separately up to 256GB from what I believe to have read) if you want to be able to see live footage or speak live through the camera. You can do those things with the sync module 2 and the subscription.

I don‚Äôt have a sync module 2 so I can only see recorded motion which it is triggered by motion or the doorbell being rang. No footage will be recorded w/o a sync module 2 and/or a subscription.

You have to rang the doorbell after each time you click save in settings in order to put those new settings in place. So be prepared for that.

Microphone makes a weird buzzing sound sometimes. I think after a few seconds of recording that‚Äôs when it kicks in. For the price of $29.99 w/ tax(I got it on sale it is showing it usually goes for $59.99), I can‚Äôt complain too much. This is one of the most affordable wireless doorbells out right now.

I know it‚Äôs the norm now but a con to be is the subscription. Without a subscription you‚Äôre pretty limited on what you can do. You might as well not buy one unless you plan on getting that. $3 a month for 1 camera and $10 a month for 1 or more.

Gotta have a sync module two for you to be able to hear the doorbell ring through the speakers on your other cameras if you have em.

Does not always catch the motion. So far it‚Äôs been good with it but a good amount of times it didn‚Äôt record motion. One instant, my child was playing outside and ran passed it and the camera didn‚Äôt record him when he ran passed it again the opposite direction. He left his play area and the camera didn‚Äôt even record that. Luckily it‚Äôs in a pretty enclosed space but that camera made me think he was still playing in that area while the whole time he wasn‚Äôt. Of course check on your kiddos but don‚Äôt reply solely on this to detect motion in front of your door at all moments. They‚Äôre also gaps between recordings.

Pros: comes with batteries, easy to set up, decent camera quality, very quick customer service(I can get ahold of someone in like 1-3 minutes). Decent camera quality even when night vision is activated. No issues with it going offline randomly like the blink mini cameras do. Small and easy to hide. Door ring has a notification that comes to your phone in the exact sound as the doorbell(phone can‚Äôt be on silent or of course you won‚Äôt hear it).",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZOHBL27UFOAK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d319b0be-5136-4845-a359-291abcb5cb00._CR0,39.0,254,254_SX48_.jpg",True,B08SG2MS3V,2024-01-19,126.0,positive,['life'],0.9708,electronics

Overall, I think if you are already a Blink customer, this is a good addition to your system.

Install: I needed one of those ""wedges"" that turns the camera to face out and using that, the install was pretty simple.  I agree with the people that noted that the back plate it comes with (which you still use when installing the wedge) is a little cheap and janky.  But the wedge is more sturdy and the resulting install is probably a little bit more solid and better than if I had just mounted the flat plate to the wall.
You do need a good sized piece of flat wood to screw everything into.  This is not going to mount well to raw siding, curved trim pieces around doors etc.  You'd have to attach a small board to the surface of anything like that and then mount it to that board.

Power vs. batteries:  I have one of those wired doorbells that is old-school, with the metal strikers that hit little chimes, not a digital doorbell.  This apparently matters because you need more power and a slightly larger transformer to drive one of those doorbells.  In turn, that means the transformer has enough power to power the blink doorbell.  If you have a digital doorbell you may (or may not) need to rely on the battery for the cameras.  It all depends on how big the transformer for your existing, wired doorbell is.  During the setup it asks you what kind of doorbell you have, and has a fairly sophisticated set of settings to make sure that when it sends a signal to the physical doorbell it is sending the correct amount of power to strike the chimes correctly.

Set-up: Very easy and painless, almost exactly the same as setting up a regular blink camera.  Put in the batteries, scan the QR code, it finds the camera, links it to your existing system/sync module and you are ready to go.

Motion Sensor: If you are already pretty familiar with Blink cameras, you know they can come with one of two kinds of sensors to detect motion.  Camera based sensors that just detect changes in the picture and more traditional sensors that only detect actual, physical movement.  The cheaper Blink mini only has a camera based sensor, while the more expensive units only detect actual physical movement with a dedicated motion sensor.  Both kinds of sensors can be triggered falsely by something like blowing leaves, but the camera-based sensors cannot distinguish changes in shadows and light from actual movement and so they have much higher rates of false detection.  Unfortunately, the blink doorbell appears to only have the cheaper detector that can be fooled by changes in light.  It does, however, have a more sophisticated, narrower grid of zones you can exclude from movement than the older Blink mini.  How much this matters to you is going to depend on where you plan to stick the camera - if you point your doorbell camera directly at a busy road and don't lock out the parts of the image that covers the road, you will get constant alerts from every car that goes by, or every person walking on the sidewalk, etc.  So think carefully about where the camera will sit and whether you want one of those wedges to tilt the direction of the thing to keep the camera aimed only at places where you actually want it to detect motion.

Video quality: Very good, with a wide angle, almost fish-eye lens, so you get very good broad coverage of the area you are pointing the camera at.  There is also a microphone that records sound while you are recording video and it seems to work ok as well.  In theory you can use the thing to have a two-way conversation with whoever is at the door, but I haven't tried that yet.  I am, overall, very happy with the camera quality for the price here.

Sound Chime/notifications:  When you push the doorbell, a chime inside the module itself goes off.  It is reasonably loud and lets the person ringing the doorbell know they definitely rang it.  The light on the button also lights up briefly to confirm the chime was pressed.  Would you, sitting inside the house, hear the chime the doorbell makes outside?  Probably, if you are in a small, quiet house.  Would you hear it  down in the basement of a large house with the TV or music on?  Absolutely not.  So if you are not hooking this up to an existing doorbell with a properly loud internal chime, then you will want to have it hooked up to your Alexa.  I don't use Alexa so didn't test that feature.  You do get a notification on your phone, when somebody rings the bell,  but I think most people will want either a hard wired connection or an Alexa connected to this thing to make sure they always hear the doorbell.

What don't I like?

I wish it had the same motion detection sensors as the larger blink cameras.  I would have paid more to get that.  Because it uses the camera to sense motion there are places where it really won't give good results.  So think very carefully about where you will place this, how often the wind will blow trees and create moving shadows within the motion detection zone, etc.

It is annoying that even when the device is hard-wired, the light around the doorbell button isn't constantly lit.  Just as if it were only running on batteries, it only lights up when you press the button.  Not a huge deal in my installation, but if you don't have a porch light on, your doorbell will not be obvious to visitors.  It is particularly odd that they put a red LED into the thing which apparently has no purpose other than in the initial setup.  The design would be much better if the lighted ring around the button was always lit and then it flashed or turned red when you pressed it.  It appears all of the hardware necessary to do that is in the device, but it is not programmed that way.  I get that when the device isn't hardwired you don't want the button lit, but when it is powered it really should be lit in the dark.

For $50, this thing is ok.  If you get it on sale, then it is a good deal, at least if you are an existing Blink customer.

I am surprised that they killed off the little bit of free cloud storage for new customers.  That can't cost very much to provide these days and it was the key differentiator between Blink and some of these other companies that provide more elaborate, high-priced options.  Blink's claim to fame is that it works well enough and is cheap.  But if you have to pay a bunch of money for cloud storage no matter what, I would probably look at the more expensive options vs. Blink.  It stops being a compelling value once you start having to pay for video storage.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2Q7YQS5LM2ZSB,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B08SGKLDRV,2022-02-26,1.0,positive,[],0.9982,electronics

From a pure value Perspective I would highly recommend this,  , easy to install,  no wires,  pretty much can put it where you want it,  Again it does everything pretty well,  One of the best prices out there,  just understand it has shortcomings,  but also understand it's price,  and it will certainly do the job for you,  this isn't a trashing review,  I  tried my hardest to be real and actually recommend it,  it just doesn't function at the upper levels of some of the others,  but it doesn't have the upper price tag , plus I am actually going to buy another,  remember,  you can put them about anywhere,  I actually have one stashed at the front of my house,  not by the door,  it gives me a full frontal view of my home when I am away,  sure it is a Doorbell but it is a camera as well and at this nice price why not,  weather elements have not hurt mine a bit in the 13 months I have had them,  including the one not by the door and pretty open to rain,  snow and cold,  it has held up well,  still ticking,  no signs of wear,  so another plus",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14Z0ZQGHIJB95,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B08SG2MS3V,2023-11-21,1.0,positive,['life'],0.9987,electronics

The cameras are surprisingly good for an iPad, with a 12MP front and back camera that produce clear, sharp photos and videos.

Battery life is another standout feature. I can easily use it throughout the day for work, browsing, and entertainment without worrying about recharging. Wi-Fi 6 ensures fast and reliable internet connections, even when I‚Äôm on the go.

The only downside is that 64GB of storage may not be enough for people who need to store a lot of files or media. Additionally, the iPad lacks the same pro-level features found in the more expensive iPad Pro models, like advanced multitasking capabilities and ProMotion display.

The smallest memory size is too small for heavy users and there is a pretty stiff upcharge for the larger configuration.

I don't like the camera bump, I only need a camera for FT so the quality that can be achieved with a flush mount is fine by me - again, see 8th/9th gen iPads.  Back to a wobbly device when laid down like on my iPhone :/  No Face ID is ridiculous at this point and the fingerprint scanner being located in the power button, while fast acting, isn't as handy as when it was easier to access on the front panel.

The good?  It's an iPad!  New centered camera on the ""selfie"" cam is good for FT, no more weird angles. The speakers are now located on both ends of the device, not just one end, for much better sound quality.  USB-C!  Huzzah, it's now possible to be totally free of Apple's proprietary connectors.  Thinner bezel now that there is no home button.

Read this first!

Look for the asterisks in the text below.  Read that area first before clicking on the buy button!

My iPad 9th generation has served me well for the past few years but the battery life was beginning to suffer and the screen had a few scratches from daily use.

I could have had the battery replaced, but that seemed to average around $100 and that was a no-go, especially since I was offered just $90 on trade in so spending more just didn‚Äôt make sense.

Now Apple wants $349 for the base 64GB unit but I‚Äôve noticed that many stores have reduced the price to $299, possibly because Apple has discontinued sales of the 9th generation and supplies are starting to dry up.

So, I jumped at the chance to get a newer version.  I‚Äôve been a good boy this year and saved my money so I could afford this.

I got mine in yellow since the better half has hers in pink.  No confusing these two.

One thing you‚Äôll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimensions are not much different from the earlier generation.

However, looks can be deceiving.  The screen goes from 10.2 inches to 10.9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom.

And that begs the question, how do I close out apps without pressing that button?

The android way, that‚Äôs how. You slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them (or choose the one you want to use).

Those of you using iPhones know this procedure well.

Yet another question I‚Äôve been asked - where‚Äôs the fingerprint ID if the button is gone?

It‚Äôs now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner.

I‚Äôd love to tell you that setup was a snap but I‚Äôd be lying.

******This iPad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old iPad.  Thought I had a dud.

Called Apple and they discovered this one  was lacking updates from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing.  Since my old iPad was already on 18.1, it was trying to force apps and settings to a new iPad that couldn‚Äôt readily take it.

Mind you, Apple verified this was indeed a brand new iPad and not a refurb or customer return.  It had just been sitting around in a warehouse for nearly 2 years.

So, in short, you‚Äôll have to do updates first, and then transfer from your old iPad.

And how do you do that?

* Sign in to your Apple account.

* Instead of allowing transfer from your iCloud or other iPad, tell it you want to do things manually.

* At that point it‚Äôll do the updates as required.

* Then you reset the iPad and start over; however, once the updates are installed they stay forever.  Now transferring from either the cloud or your open iPad should be a breeze.  A two hour breeze.

Plan on plugging it in, too.  You'll suck at least 30% of your battery doing just this procedure.*****

Now back to the review.

Overall operations are not drastically different from what I could see; however, I don‚Äôt use my iPad for heavy duty artistic work nor do I play intense games.  For Joe or Jane Everyday, this iPad won‚Äôt present any significant performance changes.

How about the screen?  Looks about the same to me.

Battery life?  Improved over my old tablet only because that battery was on its way out, but only time will tell if it is substantially better.

I will give points to Apple, though, for finally going to a USB-C charger instead of the Lightning variety.  I was getting tired of lugging different chargers around.

Now comes the last question - is this iPad worth the extra cost when you can still (possibly) find iPad 9s for $100 less?

Yes and no.  Yes, if you can get this model for $299 at which point it‚Äôs just $50 more than the 9th generation, comes with a bigger screen, and uses the readily accepted USB-C charger.

No, if you have to pay full retail of $350 or so.  At that point you might want to live with the Lightning charger and button at the bottom.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JV2VX0OS4WX0,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BJLCL22Y,2024-10-30,35.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.951,electronics

I found that support the Apple way is what I have looked for in technical support.  When you setup an iPad make sure you document every field you enter - Label also.  If you enter an email name for the Account and you forget that email name you are close to saying goodby to the iPad, I did forget what email name I entered, and Apple Support was GREAT in helping me to process the unit like it came from the factory.

Remember Amazon satisfy Apple that the unit you had purchased has been reset to factory default, if you entered an email name and forget what it is then you cannot clear that out and Apple thinks you are using the unit and if you want to return the Apple unit you can't, this means you have lost your money.  Kinda simple...

Well, I could not remember the email name I used, did I write it down or setup a record in my password list.  I looked in all my trash cans for maybe a note, could not find anything.  I use a data wallet, and it has worked but you have to keep the data - I went through my last copies of the backups for the wallet and when I got back to the DATE, I received the iPad I saw an item for iPad - I made sure I had a good paper copy, loaded the current version of wallet data and started setup of iPad again.

I'm completely unfamiliar with this type of technology, as this is the first television we've had in 20+ years, lol. My father passed away, and I ended up with an RCA television manufactured in 2013 that included an HDMI port.

My Fire TV Stick arrived about an hour ago. I went ahead and got the 4k Max, even though this TV is lower resolution, because of the extra storage available. Honestly, I wasn't convinced it was going to work, and I was certain it was going to be difficult/complex to set up.

I plugged it in, turned on the TV, which directed via a QR code to download the app on my Android phone. The instructions for set up say to make sure your phone wifi is the same as you want for your TV. I added the device in the app and just...followed the prompts, including logging into my Amazon account. It connected to my wifi, downloaded an update and BAM, I was online scrolling through movies/games/TV/etc. Took less than 15 minutes, even with me fumbling around trying to figure out the controls. Really slick!

I can't really comment on the content at this point, but there's access to both pay services and free services, plus it connects to Prime, if you have that. I have a Netflix account, and haven't yet tried adding my Netflix account vs. signing up through Amazon, but considering how easy the setup was, I suspect it won't be a problem.

This Paperwhite is crisp, lightweight, and very fast in turning the pages.....I couldn't really ask for more. I never had a glare problem with any of my previous Kindles so I can't speak to that. I would encourage people to use dark mode if they are subject to migraines/headaches....I used to be only able to read for about 20 minutes and then my migraine pain would start but when Amazon came out with dark mode years ago that problem went away completely....it also does away with the screen too yellow problem others talk about, even though you can control that with the warm light slider control.  People seem to just nit pick the new Kindles and I just don't share their complaints...I have never had a problem with location of the power button & another user complained that you can't clean the screen of this Paperwhite because it will just turn pages....ridiculous! On the toolbar menu at the top if you tap on the 'more' button there is an option to disable the touchscreen...tap on that and clean away, no problem! I will agree that this non-glare screen seems to show fingerprints more but I always wipe my phone screen off every morning so I just do my new Paperwhite at the same time. I read many hours a day, every day, and have had many kindles since the original in 2007 and in my opinion they just continue to get better.  I thought maybe I would miss the page turn buttons, but I do not, not at all! This new Paperwhite turns pages so easily and quickly that I don't miss the buttons....I hold my kindle on the side with one hand (and I have small arthritic hands)  and just move my thumb about a quarter inch and tap the side of the screen...it is so easy, quick and automatic that I don't even think about it.

Unfortunately Yes, a very resounding yes!","I've had my Kindle since 2013, I've probably read over 1,000 books on this little piece of equipment over the past 11 years as it's been the most convenient piece of electronics I've carried with me on my travels.  I originally bought my Kindle to replace a Sony e-reader I had because the glare on the Sony version made it impossible to use outside and in brightly lit rooms, upgrading to Amazon's Kindle was a huge game changer for me.

I've been resistant to upgrading my Kindle for the past 5 years because, why would I? My 2013 Kindle still works quite well, the battery life is very long, and sure, I need to reboot it every few weeks otherwise it's too slow to use, and yes, it has issues connecting to my wifi every other month.  These were minor inconveniences that didn't seem to be worth fixing for $150+.  Well, I received my new Kindle Paperwhite yesterday and my first thought was - wow, this is a lot lighter.  Then I turned it on and I was sold!  Lightening fast, responsive, warmer backlight, larger screen, and significantly improved contrast for sharper letters.

When I bought my first e-reader in 2011 (Sony), I had to turn it off during take off and landing. We've come a long way since then and we know that an e-reader and other small personal electronics don't impact airplane instruments and you can read away non-stop on flights.

Long story short? I loved that device... Literally, to death... After dropping it on terrazzo floors in SEVERAL airports world-wide, not to mention the myriad spills at home on more forgiving carpet. In fact, I loved it so much that when the 11th gen Scribe went on fire-sale a few weeks ago, I bought the cheapest version to replace my original (recently non-functional) unit, simply swapping my old premium pen for the basic one. Clearly, I loved the device enough to buy it again... I adore the ability to mark up .pdf's, the note-taking capabilities and that even with this extra functionality, it's still a very limited device that allows me to focus on reading first.

What I don't love, and never have? The weight. It's heavy to the point that I never used it if I couldn't prop it on something. Which led to it being dropped. A lot. Which led to the original unit failing. Not that it wasn't pretty sturdy... I mean, it survived repeated collisions with very unforgiving surfaces. It even weathered some relatively large liquid spills on and near it despite not being water resistant.  Now? I just use the Scribe when I need to mark up .pdf's (like, when I'm gaming... I can keep my character sheets on the Kindle), or need something that can display larger printed materials... Like RPG basic books or comics.  Hence, the new Kindle Paperwhite gen 12...

My new device isn't appreciably different than my Scribe except in a couple very important ways. The reviews don't lie... The screen contrast is higher, and in good light without backlighting, looks whiter. The device is much smaller, and seems a touch slimmer. It's also, very importantly, less than half as heavy, which means it's comfortable to hold in one hand while reading without tiring. I don't need to set it down on things, or prop it up, which reduces the threat of drops. When I'm out in public, I do have a cover for the device, and because it's so light, you can hold it open like a paperback, and it won't overbalance and fall out of your hand. The screen, given that it's half the size of the Scribe, seems to refresh much faster. It also seems to load the store faster, and settings menu navigation is measurably faster, as well. This is not surprising. The device is newer, and has less functionality. The one thing that I have detracted a star for is the battery life. I don't use the pen on the Scribe unless I'm actually writing, as it drains battery quickly. When you're turning pages with the touch-screen, however, you get exceptional battery life out of the Scribe. Not so terribly much on the Paperwhite. Granted, I'm not the average reader. 30 minutes a day is amateurish. When I use the backlight all day, I'm running down the battery at least 10% on the Paperwhite, if not more. Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but gone are the days of not bringing a charging cord for a two week vacation as I did with the Scribe.

I hear a lot of people make noise about the format... AKA, the Paperwhite doesn't have the extended lip on the side like the Oasis to make it easier to hold, and that it doesn't have buttons. Well, I understand that personal preference is personal preference, but... Who the heck wants another point of mechanical failure on a device that goes through a lot of punishment in public? I don't want my precious page-turn button breaking. Ever. And, let's face it... That's why everything is touch-screen these days. Yes, you might have to clean the screen more often, or bother to wash your hands before using your precious device (which you really SHOULD be doing, anyway), but these aren't exactly deal-breakers. Another thing that's come up even in professional reviews is people ""accidentally"" activating the bottom button. The question I have is, HOW?!? You need to alter your grip for leverage to depress it, the device is so light. The only other thing I've mused on is that the Paperwhite is just a plain plastic thing. It doesn't have the flashy aluminum back-side of the Oasis or even the Scribe... It doesn't look as luxe in the hand. And honestly? After the durability and weight issues I've mentioned above, I just plain don't care. If I'm in public, my device is in a case, anyway. I'm not an Apple person. While I experience SOME e-vanity, I don't think of my Kindle as a fashion accessory. Rather the opposite, as some people judge one harshly for going with an Amazon device in the first place. I'm here to read, and you probably are too if you're bothering to read this review.

All in all, it took less than a week for the Paperwhite to become my favored reading device for its' portability, its' weight and its' utility. I love the tiny thing! I look forward to years of care-free, comfortable reading without worrying so much about dropping my favorite note-taking device and general scratch-pad, the Scribe.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N2C0JP3FPQSM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-15,40.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.9701,electronics

I mostly watch TV, read newspapers, and read lots of online news websites.  I have not been a fan of reading books, but with this Kindle that is starting to change.  This makes reading easy and enjoyable.

I can only comment on my 2024 Kindle Paperwhite, but I don't see most of the issues cited in some 1-star reviews as showstoppers.  I find the ads on the cover screen are a minor inconvenience and certainly not worth spending $20 to eliminate.  The adds don't draw any power draining the battery, and they disappear as soon as you open a book to read.  Comments about a yellow tint surprise me, especially one review that included a picture that showed a definite yellow tint.  The reviewer had the warmth setting partially on, and of course, the screen had a yellow tint.  Set warmth to zero and brightness to 80% or more, and the screen background is what most people would consider paperwhite. I might turn on warmth and reduce screen brightness when reading in bed, in a dark room next to my sleeping wife, but I am very happy with the screen white color and readability.

I purchased the optional 9W charger, and it took my battery from 50 to 99% in about an hour and a half.  It is a nice charger block.  It annoys me companies no longer supply free power cubes, but even Apple stopped supplying power cubes with their iPhones.  So, it is what it is.  I didn't wait for 100% because Li batteries are stressed and take a long time to get through the last bit of charging to get to absolute 100% charge.

The Amazon branded cloth cover is very nice, maybe a bit overpriced, but you get what you pay for.  The cover color perfectly matches the color of my kindle, it is thin and lightweight, fits snuggly, and it folds back out of the way when reading.  Compared to the old cover on my 2nd gen Kindle, this this one is much less bulky.  The texture of the cover makes it less likely I will drop it on the floor.  I'm glad I went with the Amazon cover.  Make sure you are ordering the correct cover.  If you buy a 2024, 12th edition Kindle, make sure you buy the cover for the 2024 Kindle, and not the 11th edition.

A word about the trade-in offer.  I found it a bit confusing.  It said 20% off with trade-in, but when I chose the trade-in, it only appraised the value of my very old 2nd gen Kindle at $5. I assumed the 20% was a max trade-in, but they gave me 20% off plus $5.  With the black-Friday pricing, it was  a great deal.

There was an offer on the webpage of three months free Kindle Unlimited, but after I worked through the trade-in and chose the three piece bundle (Kindle, cover, and charger). the offer disappeared.  When I received and turned on my Kindle for the first time, the same offer came on the screen.  So, no harm done.  Overall, I really like the new 2024 Paperwhite.

Display & Design:
The Kindle Paperwhite 12th Gen features a 6.8-inch glare-free display, which makes reading under direct sunlight or low-light environments a breeze.

With 8GB or 32GB options, there‚Äôs plenty of space for thousands of books, PDFs, and audiobooks. Audiobook lovers will appreciate the seamless integration with Audible via Bluetooth headphones, making it easy to switch between reading and listening.

Amazon‚Äôs Kindle ecosystem continues to offer useful features like Word Wise, X-Ray, and Goodreads integration. The 12th Gen Kindle Paperwhite also supports Kindle Unlimited and Prime Reading, giving access to an endless selection of books.

So lets review THIS model.

The sliding response time is slightly slower than a phones and dragging your finger fully across the screen only gives you 1 single page turn. Not ten, you won't be missing chunks of the book you are reading because you moved your finger a bit. In fact it seems to only turn the page after you slide roughly an inch either left to right.

However single taps are only slightly less sensitive than the average phone, so if you repeatedly tap left or right you'll flip through pages quickly. Make of that what you will.

The feel of the screen is lovely, in the image I tried to capture the texture of the screen using a bright light, it didn't reflect the light much so it does have that glare-free thing going for it.

The screen brightness and contrast is nice, I can't speak to what it once was but it is more slightly yellow than my phone at max white, and that helps with eye-strain, but perhaps not aesthetic for some. While I've yet to need bifocals that day is coming soon so I personally prefer the ability to read longer without discomfort.

As for longevity and battery life, again this bad boy was released on Oct 16, 2024 and today is the 20th. I can say I charged it, connect to wi-fi- and downloaded a bunch of audio-books and various books and then read 15% of a book with the brightness at half and I'm at 95% battery life, which doesn't seem bad for the amount of downloading this did.

Weighs about as much as my phone with a case on it, is easy to read at angles, is easy to navigate and quick to wake up. Wish I'd timed how fast it charged but I plugged it in a made some bread and it was charged fully from 57% when I was done.

However, I'm a bit frustrated with the set-up on this one. Some of this is operator error -- I've been trying to download too many books at a time, which keeps freezing up the system. So that's on me (and why this version currently gets 4 stars instead of 3). But when I first registered my device (which went smoothly) and then opened up my library, I discovered all but a handful of my books (of which I have well over 2000) were showing up as unread or partially read even though I currently only have 2 unread books. At first I hoped that the system would catch up (this was prior to me downloading books onto the new Kindle) as my content library on Amazon showed the books correctly marked as ""read"", but that didn't seem to happen so I manually went through and marked them all as read. To be fair, I found a few errors in my organizing in doing this so was able to fix a few things. Still, it was a frustration and time consuming. I should note that I did check for and ran the update when I first started the Kindle, too.

After two restarts to unfreeze the Kindle (again, probably my fault from trying to download too many books at once) plus a third one when the screen suddenly prompted me to register my device again (after having already done it and having 775 books already downloaded), I am going much more slowly on downloading so hopefully the rest of the process will finally go more smoothly.

One other quirk was a couple books that had been placed in collections suddenly showed up in the uncollected folder. Not sure if I somehow accidentally removed them from their collections (don't see how, though) or what was going on.

Oh one other quirk I nearly forgot was that my library was showing that I had 42 library books even though all had been long returned. So I also had to re-return them as part of the process of getting this Kindle ready to use.

I'm guessing this next concern is because it was trying to download books last night, but it was fully charged at around midnight and when I checked it about 8am this morning, it was down to 7% battery charge.

I'm hopeful all will be fine when all is said and done, but what I thought was going to be an hour long process is well into the double digits of hours with work left to be done. Ah well, I'm sure once it's all done and I can focus on reading, this frustration will simply be an unpleasant memory.

In early 2019 I got the Paperwhite 10th generation, which was really nice (300 dpi made a BIG difference, although I pined for the large screen of the DX).

When Amazon sent me a blurb to meet the new kindle family, I decided to get the 12th generation kindle paperwhite in teal (it is more of a turquoise/aqua, NOT a jade green, just saying) regular (non-signature) edition.

My other paperwhite still works so I decided to keep it and not trade it in.  This paperwhite isn't much more yellow, which is great (I don't like the yellow hue).  If I turn off the warmth, it looks VERY similar to the 10th generation.  I don't read at a beach or bathtub or pool so I'm not going to test the waterproof feature.

The kindle is very thin, and I felt sometimes on the 6"" screen that I was speedreading without meaning to (I only read fiction, and I have the font at 6 bookerly).  This 7"" screen is really nice.  It feels more natural and I can immerse myself better.

Also, imagine to my delight that when I set the kindle up I offered me three months of free kindle unlimited.  The selection on that plan has really expanded and I have a big wishlist (smiley).

I declined the audible 30 day free trial, but it offered that, too.

Now I'm just waiting for the snap back/magnetic front cases to have some pattern that I like.

I usually don't upgrade things until they break (still using a 4 1/2 year old iphone SE 2020 and 2019 ipad) but I'm really happy that I decided to just treat myself to this kindle.

My other kindle (the 2019 paperwhite) is nicknamed awesome kindle in my account; this one I nicknamed beautiful kindle.

I hope everyone else loves their kindle as much as me (and yes, I still read physical books, too).  I remember learning how to read; it opened a whole new world to me.  I don't read to the point of being anti-social (LOL), but I definitely enjoy it on the bus, on my lunch hour, and relaxing at home, and in much downtime (single, no kids, basic 40 hour a week job).

Thank you for reading.  I know many people are commenting on the kindle and I just felt inclined to join in.

First, the Alexa app is buggy about connecting to Apple Music. It isn't just a problem with the latest version because Reddit is full of threads from 2 and 4 years ago about getting error messages after logging into an Apple account from this app. Fortunately, one of those threads pointed me to a link, on the Amazon website, where I was able to link my Apple Music account the way it should be able to be linked through the Alexa app. After that, I was able to connect Apple Music to the Alexa app, and voice commands to the Dot now work fine for listening to my playlists.

Second, I had an issue using the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker to play Apple Music via AirPlay. It connects and plays the music fine, but the Dot makes extremely, ear-splitting, smoke-alarm loud announcements whenever it connects to my phone via Bluetooth. Since I was trying to use my phone in the middle of the night for ambient music to help sleep, and since this was more than loud enough to disturb my upstairs neighbors, AirPlay was a no-go. As for the previous issue, a quick search yielded years of Reddit threads about this issue, but no solutions other than to not connect any devices to the Dot via Bluetooth.

So, it was a rough first day with the Alexa app failing to connect me to the music source I subscribe to - I'm guessing it works just fine for Amazon Music - and with the Dot itself making such loud announcements if I try to use AirPlay that there is just no reasonable way for me to live with the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker. But if I block the Dot from connecting with my phone, it works great as intended - with Alexa voice commands. The sound quality is as good as you'd expect from such a tiny speaker, and exactly what I wanted for bedtime music in an apartment building - very clear sound with little bass, so that I can listen to podcasts or ambient music at 2 AM and not bother neighbors.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XTKWS0C2QORF,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B8V1LZ3,2024-10-16,38.0,positive,['great'],0.9076,electronics

It was a white shuffleboard stone covered in cloth and it is amazing. I'll never say it's not; in fact it's so amazing that I passed it on to my mom and she enjoys it a great deal.

So, my main motivation for purchasing this, the fifth generation issued in 2022 ‚Äì aside from familiarity with the brand ‚Äì was I needed a Matter hub so my then-incoming Nanoleaf smart lightbulbs could work with my voice. But of course it is so much more.

First thing I see is that the Echo Dot is no longer a white shuffleboard stone but is a smaller, navy blue sphere. Aside from being my favorite color, and thus very pleasing to look at, I find it that it is not practical any longer to mount on my wall because of its increased focus on the forward firing speaker; if I had mounted it, it would not be effective in spreading out to my entire room ‚Äì the top of the speaker is reserved for the buttons which were present on the third-generation: volume up, volume down, action/wake and mute microphone, which leave no room for a speaker in that area. So it sits pretty on my side table facing the rest of my room, and does fine.

First thing I hear is the sound quality is so much better than the third-generation Dot. The third-generation was okay in that regard, but it tended to sound a little overexposed when the volume was up high. Now, I don't find myself connecting via Bluetooth to my sound bar nearly as much because the speaker quality is just that good. The quiet parts of music are quiet and calming the way they should be, but the bass thumps quite effectively, surprisingly for such a small and lightweight speaker.

So after I'd established the smart speaker in my room for about a month, I felt the time was right to go ahead and get my Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs, to upgrade the ones that I had no longer been able to use for a year since they had stopped working with any voices assistants, to facilitate compatibility with the then upcoming network standard: Matter. I am very happy to say that Matter compatibility is there and it is wonderful.

I can't speak for the internal workings because I'm not an engineer; I will say ‚Äì though I may be wrong about this ‚Äì that I believe it would be more rocky if I did not have a Thread Border Router already in the form of my Nanoleaf shapes controller; I have the shapes arrangement atop my desk called Dragon, and it has worked wonderfully for me since around last September, and only ‚Äì at this point anyway ‚Äì required regular firmware updates to be compatible with ongoing technology.

Now, I'll tell you the procedure for adding the Nanoleaf Essentials bulbs to Alexa via Matter ‚Äì I would assume by extension any Matter device, providing you have a thread border router like I mentioned before. After adding the bulbs to the iOS Nanoleaf app as normal ‚Äì also updating the firmware for each bulb via said app! I have a feeling that was very important ‚Äì add them also to Alexa via the Add Device flow, one at a time. There was a menu item that showed itself at the top telling me that it had detected each new bulb on my network and I only had to select that item to add it, scan the QR code on the sticker that came with the bulbs (I applied the sticker to a sheet of paper and labeled it according to the positions of the bulbs) and wait just a bit for it to be connected and it just works!

Another new feature which the third-generation did not have is a temperature sensor! After a short period of calibration after plugging the device in, Alexa will be able to tell you the temperature of the room that it is situated in! I ask her for this often when I'm trying to determine how best to cool my room during these hot summer months. When my door's closed during the day, my room can get up to mid 80s, which is horrible, but with the door open to allow a draft and breeze, the temperature's equalized with the rest of the house and I get mid to upper 70s which is much better.

There is an ultrasound presence sensor, which sounds not unlike sonar, which I have not had a use for yet, but I imagine routines can be enabled or suppressed with its use.

One borderline negative thing I will say about it which I'm okay with because, again, I have Bluetooth connections ‚Äì they eliminated the 3.5 mm jack to save internal space inside the device, so you will no longer be able to directly connect external speakers, as I did at one point before I had to change that arrangement.

I have limited mobility, and sometimes every day tasks can be challenging.  I‚Äôm always on the lookout for ways to make life easier, as well as safer.  I‚Äôm a fan of smart devices for that very reason.  I enjoy, dare I say ‚Äúrely‚Äù, on the convenience of being able to sync my phone with my Dot in order to; turn on any one of my lights, adjust the temperature in my home, activate and/or manage my security devices.
In addition, being able to speak to my Dot has made it so I don‚Äôt have to walk, or even move, if my back or hips are having a particularly bad day.  Dot has literally improved the quality of life.
I have discovered that this small sphere, with its powerful speaker, will be key in maintaining my ability to live independently for as long as possible.  On August 18th, slightly past midnight, I fell in my kitchen.  The fall stunned me and I started to go into shock.  For some reason my watch didn‚Äôt detect that I had fallen.  Something it had done successfully in the past.  That meant emergency services would not be alerted.  I tried to stand up( something that would have been challenging under normal circumstances)‚Ä¶.I couldn‚Äôt do it.  My next thought was to try and scoot to the table.  My body was riddled with pain the moment I attempted to do this.  I knew I was hurt, but the severity of my injury had not quite registered.  I reached down to shift my leg and it swayed freely in my hands.  I didn‚Äôt know it, but my femur had snapped slightly below my hip.  That‚Äôs when fear started to take hold. No watch, no phone‚Ä¶.what was I going to do?  Then I remembered Dot.  I asked her to call my emergency contacts.  She did it!  Unfortunately, none heard their phones.  It‚Äôs late at night, and they were all asleep.  The pain was becoming severe and I was scared.  I asked Alexa to call 911, but she told me she couldn‚Äôt do that!  I didn‚Äôt expect that.  Then I asked Alexa to call the security office at my complex.  They answered and I was able to let them know I had fallen and I had broken my leg.
As I said, I‚Äôm disabled.  I had an emergency plan in place.  This plan had worked for me in the past.  Nothing is fool proof.  I learned the importance of having a backup plan.  Thankfully I received my Dot about 3 weeks prior to my fall.  I also decided to place it in my kitchen so I could listen to music while I cooked.  I never imagined I‚Äôd be using my Dot for an emergency.

Got it cheap on sale, I think it was during Amazon prime day. Stuck it in the garage so I can check the ""outside"" temp before going out and to have something to play music in the garage while working out there. Sounds good playing music even at full volume.

The usual problems with Amazon devices not understanding the difference between being told to turn something ""on"" and ""off"".  If have several lights as a group and already have one of those lights on and you tell it to turn on the group it turns off the entire group instead of turning it on. Takes several tries before it turns on the lights. After a while you get used to it. You say it once and wait a little bit and if nothing happens or it turns everything off then just don't wait for the lights to change state but just repeat command several times in a row quickly and then it works. Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... Alexa turn on lights... and then stop once it turns the lights on. And oh yeah not to mention if told to turn on ""kitchen"" it would sometimes turn on ""fan"" instead which is the light in the living room ceiling fan.

I ordered one of these a few days ago, spent a few hours trying to set it up, consulted the internet, and nothing really worked. It continually got stuck at the ""searching for wifi"" step and being unsuccessful in finding *any* networks. I tried manually connecting it, using a mobile hotspot, restarting my router, etc etc etc. It could not find ANY signal at all. I called customer support, did a hard reset, tried some things, and still nothing. The lady recommended I return the device and order a new one, so I got a refund, returned the first unit, and ordered a new one.

I was conflicted whether I should order this same model again or try a completely different smart speaker. Ultimately I decided to give it one more shot and I received the new unit today. Plugged it in, had guarded hopes. Again, same issue that it couldn't find a network to connect to. So I shut off Bluetooth and tried manual connection again. This time, a list of networks came up! ... but not my network. So I ""added"" my network, and it would glitch and start over. I tried half a dozen times to add my network, and it still wouldn't show up or connect. I tried another hard reset for the device, and repeated adding my network again to no avail. Back to consulting the internet! I hard reset the device, and followed a guide I found on Reddit. Still, it didn't work with my wifi network, so I had the idea to download the alexa app on my tablet and use my phone hotspot instead of my wifi. I read something that if you leave the app page for ANY reason during setup (even just the device falling asleep for a second or two), the app will glitch and connection with fail. So I hard reset the device again, added device, selected the echo dot, disconnected my tablet's bluetooth, selected manual connection in the app, then connected to the Amazon ""wifi"" network, let it search for wifi, came up with a list that didn't include mine, and so I manually added my hotspot network's name and password. It did it's little loading thing, and sent me back to the searching for wifi page. The list of networks came up again and alas, it happened! My hotspot appeared on the network page! I clicked it, feeling as though Alexa were playing tricks on me but after all my failed attempts, it finally connected! .... to my hotspot, but at least there was a shred of hope somewhere in the universe that this tiny, frustrating device had some potential, if only I could just add my personal wifi network instead!

So all I had to do was spend another hour repeatedly fiddling with the app trying to add a new network so I could move it off of my hotspot to my wifi. I followed the same steps that worked for the hotspot connection (minus the hard reset) and after the third or fourth attempt, it finally connected.... And then I had to unplug it to move it to it's permanent location 10 feet away from my router- I did all this at the same outlet my router is plugged into because it was struggling so much. I considered just leaving if there for eternity because I didn't want to risk it reseting and having to deal with all the connection issues again. You have no idea the relief I felt when I plugged it into its permanent outlet and it automatically reconnected. If I had to mess with the setup process from scratch again, I probably would've just returned it again.

I don't understand how this is a 5th generation device with such a flawed and frankly crappy set up process. I had to go digging through my router settings, app settings, restarted/reset the device multiple times, rebooted my router, consulted customer support, poked around multiple online forums, and spent hours trying to get this cursed little orb functioning. That said, it is now working. We'll see how it holds up over the next few weeks. If it had so much trouble finding my wifi in the first place, I'm curious to see how it'll hold up and if it will stay connected or continue posing issues. All I know is when I move out and have to set it up again in a few years.... lord help me.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R315A2D3B5PDVB,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B8V1LZ3,2024-10-05,13.0,negative,"['hard', 'hard', 'hard', 'hard', 'hard']",-0.9747,electronics

You can definitely receive calls from other Echo devices. I‚Äôve done that with my cousin. No problem. What limits general phone redirect isn‚Äôt your phone brand, it‚Äôs your mobile provider. Only a few providers offer additional charge services that allow you to receive any mobile call via this device. Other than in this comment, you likely won‚Äôt find that out without installing and learning to navigate the Alexa app.

** I started this comment with the asterisk note because that type of notifcation is lacking from web and print info about the Echo. The quick start guide (the only user manual in print you receive) just states that a green light ring means:

You have an incoming call. Say ‚ÄúAlexa, answer the call.‚Äù

What you don‚Äôt receive in writing is any printed documentation about who can and can‚Äôt call you.

It took one replacement device and two calls to the Alexa help line for me to get a solid answer about the issue. Please understand, the Echo works well for what it should do. The problem is that information is tucked several links into an app which you may need help to navigate at all. I‚Äôm giving one star down because Amazon has made the app needlessly hard to navigate and they‚Äôve also failed to update online help information. Some important user info about the Alexa app is well out of date! For example, to get to the info I‚Äôm discussing here, you‚Äôll first need to go the Communications tab which online help will say is at the bottom of the home screen. I was told by support that it used to be on the home screen, but Amazon removed it from there. You now have to first navigate to that tab to even start trying to find incoming call access info.

The watch is very easy to use. Like upgrading any other Apple device, it was an easy transfer from the old watch, well worth the upgrade, and well worth the price.

The watch looks great, I paired it with a AMBAND case. I feel that case adds a lot of protection to the watch, without impacting functionality. For additional durability, I also got a screen protector.

We just got our echo a few months ago. I‚Äôve been a prime member for over 10 years so I‚Äôm familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It‚Äôs been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I‚Äôm an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven‚Äôt had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I‚Äôve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I‚Äôm not sure what that is about.
ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it‚Äôs not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn‚Äôt just recognize it.
Setup:
Since my Alexa didn‚Äôt recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to ‚Äúturn off plug one‚Äù and it turned off! It is so cool!
Future:
I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.
Comparing:
With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can‚Äôt see myself buying any more than 1 for $25.  Too many are 2 for $20. While it‚Äôs nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can‚Äôt afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.
Overall:
If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome! But if you‚Äôre on a tight budget like I am, I would try a different brand first and see if those will work just as well.
Every time I purchase something online, I always check the reviews. I count on others to help me choose the best option. My reviews are always my honest opinion and I try to include photos if possible.

My priorities:
Fast streaming/minimal lag
Easy to navigate
Access to shows of interest
Ability to preview as i fast forward or rewind

Apple TV:
Expensive
Can't preview or issues with some of the apps that was frustrating.  it wanted to rewind or fast foward instead of clicking to the screen section you wanted with a preview.  This really killed the device for me.
Easy to overshoot if you used the finger swipe option to quickly move fast-forward or rewind.
User interface, for the most part is decent and fast except for how navigates while playing.

Fire TV
Built to sell products instead of show shows, laggy, and for whatever reason I hated interacting with this device. Not being able to easily access the content I wanted due to poor organization really rubbed me the wrong way.
Pro - ability to bootleg shows, but not something I'm into and I only checked this out during the first weeks of covid.
I want to emphasize the lag issues.  This is built as cheap as possible to minimally meet requirements to function and it shows.

Roku
So, now that I have the other devices out of the way, and ignore my LG streaming which is my favorite, I'll speak to this device and why it has my vote.

This device is surprisingly fast.  I didn't expect a device that was almost as responsive as my apple TV and LG TV.  This is slightly slower but barely and no lag which is the most critical thing for me.
We got this for the British Bake-off access which led to an unexpected cool thing.  The discovery of the free shows, if you don't absolutely hate commercials.  For the complete British Bake-off experience, we mute the commercials.  So, the additional channels that Roku provides has made it continue to be useful.
Roku allows a preview of channels as I fast forward through it.
Roku does have an issues with some apps where I need to log out and go back in so the remote works correctly.  I'm not sure if that's a bad app issue or the device but a quick back and in fixes.  The apple device has never crashed or become buggy on me.  The Firestick has, but it's cheap.
The price is significantly cheaper than apple making the Roku a no brainer.
Unlike the apple TV, which requires counter space, this plugs into the back of the TV and is hidden away.

Now, an issue I had when I first turned on is that my remote was not communicating with the device.  I was extremely annoyed as this was an early Christmas present for my wife, and I wanted it to function within a certain time window so a return and replace would have ruined it.  The device showed the remotes power but didn't communicate.  After resetting the device, the remote works fine now.  If you run into an issue, try resetting the device.

4k streaming?  It's okay.  I didn't do a side by side.  It has 4k.

Navigation?  It's simple enough but could be made better. I thought the last version of the Fire TV was worse.  The apple TV does shine in this area on most apps I played with.  My biggest gripe with navigation in Roku is that marking something as favorite and then LOCATING the favorites from Roku's channels and free shows, was not intuitive.  I did eventually find my favorites, but that was frustrating.  Additionally, the channel/app/inventory searching involves clicking to the right instead of down.

So, speed is slightly less than Apple, but barely.  Navigation is slightly less easy based on the layout vs apple, and i think it's better than the Fire the last time I used that thing.  The Roku has a nice access to misc. free channels.  Its price is a quarter of Apple.  The fire TV?  I don't consider these two in the same league.

So, if you're picking up a streaming device, I'd recommend the Roku over the other devices (except the LG TV native streaming app which is the best I've used).  Performance and price are good.  The only reason to avoid is if it doesn't have access to what you want to watch.  For me, it filled in the gaps and provided baking shows that we otherwise didn't have access to.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PWYY2ORZ27KA,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09BKCDXZC,2022-12-21,573.0,positive,['useful'],0.9868,electronics

I‚Äôve been pretty slavish about using the devices from Roku that supported wired ethernet instead of relying on WiFi because I don‚Äôt want to deal with buffering or lag, and just didn‚Äôt have confidence in WiFi (despite having WiFi-6). Other streaming devices (which shall remain nameless) with WiFi-only connection have disappointed me.

My previous Roku died over the holidays and so I took a chance (and a gift card) to try out this Roku 4k stick. I‚Äôm glad I did.

First off, I needn‚Äôt have worried about the WiFi not being up to streaming 4k video from my server. It handles it just fine. It‚Äôs a good experience as long as you have a newer router that supports WiFi-6.

Second, setup was amazingly easy. They‚Äôve streamlined the whole process, and any apps you were already using on another Roku device are instantly logged in and ready to go. New big-name apps are almost as easy, just requiring a QR code scan and a quick login to the app on your phone.

My biggest  complaint is that something about this Roku really pumps up the saturation in some of my own home-edited videos. I can‚Äôt figure out which setting is making that a thing, but it‚Äôs clearly something to do with the way my video editing app saves the video. Roku just isn‚Äôt playing nice with it, but that‚Äôs not on Roku; that‚Äôs in the editor. Everything else, however, looks incredibly good.

The interface is snappy, and honestly I was shocked that this stick is faster to load and navigate than my previous Roku Ultra LT.

I can think of only one negative point to the stick, and that is that it only works with the special remote it comes with, which I believe is a sort of WiFi direct connection. It won‚Äôt support an IR remote nor a Bluetooth one, rendering my universal remote useless for the Roku streaming stick 4k. It also won‚Äôt work with most of the stack of previous model Roku remotes I own. And of course, as with every Roku remote, the four quick-launch buttons are a pain in the neck. I only subscribe to one of the services in them, and will likely never subscribe to the others, which means accidentally pressing them is a bit of an obnoxious experience. I understand they‚Äôre sponsored and Roku makes money putting them on their remotes and making them permanent, but they could ‚Ä¢at least‚Ä¢ add two more buttons in there that are fully programmable to access the favorites we actually do subscribe to.

The voice search function is handy, but sometimes the screen will prompt you to use the voice search when the normal manual actions are easier and more direct. I don‚Äôt really need to press the voice button and say ‚Äúlaunch YouTube‚Äù when I can just press the OK button on the first app in my list (YouTube) and it launches. However, for searching for a specific movie or show, it‚Äôs a great feature. It‚Äôs also nice for people who hate typing on screen using directional buttons, as you can speak letter-by-letter to enter email addresses and passwords if need be.

Bottom line: I‚Äôm impressed. Except for a few minor caveats, it‚Äôs a great streaming device that is responsive, intuitive, and provides fantastic video and audio quality, even up to Dolby Atmos in a 4k stream.

Reviews for the Roku Streaming Stick 4K promise a clean interface without all the ads for other streaming services you don't have.  I found the installation fast and friendly and like that it promises to be able to control your TV and soundbar too.  It does all of this, but with issues.

The interface is super clean, showing just the icons for the services you add to the homepage, but now I find myself having to launch each of my individual streaming services to see what's new on each service, whereas the FireTV pushes new releases, albeit among other advertised shows/movies for rent or on other subscription services offering trial subscriptions.  Some middle ground seems like a better balance now that' I've seen both perspectives.

My bigger issue is with the remote.  It is a bit fatter than the FireTV and has an awkward plastic ROKU branded tag sticking out of the bottom.  Is this a better user experience than just printing some branding on the unit?  No.  The TV controls work about 50% of the time for me, not always being able to turn my Sony TV on/off, but volume control of my Vizio soundbar works 100% of the time.  The biggest issue is the workaround you have to do to watch TV with bluetooth headphones/earbuds, if you like to watch at night and not wake up your household or when you're working out and don't want to blast the TV to hear dialogue, since bluetooth is not built into the unit.  Whereas the FireTVs all have bluetooth that can connect directly with bluetooth speakers/earbuds/headphones and game controllers, the Roku forces you to install/launch their remote control app on your cell phone, set your cell phone on the same wi-fi network as the Roku, pair your bluetooth headphones with your cell phone, and then calibrate the sound/video delay between what you're seeing on the TV with what you're hearing through the app, because of the lag created by using your phone as the middleman.  This clunky approach means every time your phone gets any notification or tries to put ""background apps"" to sleep to save power, it drops the sound to your headphones, but keeps playing the video.  What?!?  And because it doesn't save your calibration, you have to adjust the audio/video delay every time you reconnect.  This also burns your phone battery down because your phone has to maintain this connection and seems to only stay consistently connected if the remote app is open on your screen and not asleep.  If you mess around with other apps that play any sound while you are watching TV with your headphones (especially YouTube), it will drop the Roku sound and you'll have to start over.  Very frustrating waste of time for something that should be built-in by now; everything has bluetooth nowadays and Roku has been around for years!  The remote's buttons have a good feel, but feel slightly laggy and I find myself having to hit them twice sometime during every sitting, because it didn't register a key-press.  My FireTV remotes (bluetooth) are all more snappy and responsive.  The Roku RF remote is just slightly slower.  Lastly, I can only use 1 of its preset streaming subscription quick-launch buttons.  It has Netflix (#1 in subscribers), Disney+ (#3), Paramount+ (#5), and AppleTV+ (#8), whereas I subscribe to Netflix (#1), PrimeVideo (#2), Hulu (#6), and Peacock (#7).  My older FireTV Max 4K remote has 3 of these; but it looks like even the newest FireTV Max remotes have replaced Hulu with Peacock now, so it's just a luck of the draw when you purchase.

The price of the Roku is very reasonable, requires no subscription, and if you don't ever watch TV with bluetooth headphones, my biggest complaint won't apply, but there are still other issues that keep this from being a top choice in my opinion.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L0ILR53WLU0H,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09BKCDXZC,2024-11-25,3.0,positive,[],0.9926,electronics

Prior to that I had the basic kindle from 2019. While I love the paperwhite and its features, I quickly found that it can be fairly uncomfortable and awkward to hold compared to my old 6 inch kindle. It is also noticeably heavier.

I ultimately decided to purchase this new kindle and as soon as I took it out of the box I knew I made the right call. I purchased the matcha color, which I was hesitant to do because I didn‚Äôt really love how it looked in the pictures but also didn‚Äôt want just plain black. I am SO glad I chose the matcha. It isn‚Äôt as vibrant as it appears in the ad photos which I really like. It is very similar to the agave green paperwhite color. I also love that the whole device is the same color rather than just the back being colored.

As for the page turning speed, I don‚Äôt see much of a difference between this kindle and the previous paperwhite model. The page turning wasn‚Äôt something that ever bothered me, but they really emphasized this ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù in the advertising so I was hoping for more. But again, certainly not a deal breaker for me.

In terms of the difference in features between this model and the paperwhite, I don‚Äôt feel as though I am missing out on much. The one feature I would have loved to see on this kindle that the paperwhite has is the adjustable warmth of the screen color.

I also have a 2024 Kobo Clara and there is very little difference in the two devices - the lighting is good on both, the weight is very slightly less on the Kindle, although not by enough to matter, and the speed is equivalent on both devices.

As far as usability, the Kindle is locked to Amazon's system, so if you get books from Google, Kobo, or Barnes and Noble, you won't be able to read them on this device without stripping the DRM, which is illegal. That said, you can borrow books from your local library if you first go to the library web page and check the book out. Then you designate that you want to read it on your Kindle and link your Amazon account, at which time it will show up in your books. On the Kobo Clara, you can browse and borrow books directly from the library, which I find more convenient.

Battery life on the two devices seems comparable as well. I have not seen a measurable difference when reading with the wifi turned off (unless I'm syncing, I have it turned off) Page turns also seem identical, which is a big improvement over the older Paperwhite I had before. The home screen and settings are easier to use and navigate on the Kobo Clara, but if you are used to the Kindle interface, nothing will have changed. It looks much the same as my very old Kindle Touch.

This device does not have page turn buttons (neither does the Kobo Clara BW) so if you want that feature, you'll have to get the more expensive models, but both have USB C charging via cable, which is nice. I can finally recycle the last of the old charging cables! You cannot service any aspect of this reader, which is not a huge problem for me, but I still think owners should be able to replace batteries or screens on devices that come with a price tag like this, but that's another discussion entirely. For what it's worth, the Kobo Clara is user-serviceable, just sayin'!

Cost-wise, I chose the Kindle over the Paperwhite because I did not see the value in spending that much more for a few minor features. The screen resolution is fantastic and the size makes it far more portable than the larger Paperwhite. Even with the case on, I can fit this into a back pocket or jacket pocket easily.

Overall, this is a solid choice for an e-reader, although I find that since I get books from different places, having two devices is required (Kindle for Amazon books, Kobo for all other sources) If you want the specific features the Paperwhite has, are OK with paying that much more for them, this might not be the choice for you.

Well, the first one arrives and the ghosting is pretty bad. Customer service did their best but we decided to exchange it. I was assured the replacement would NOT ghost. Got the replacement today and sadly there is still a little ghosting‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs barely there. I‚Äôm worried it will become worse as I use it. So far the book pages refresh well enough that it isn‚Äôt a noticeable issue while reading, but it gets irritating when I am navigating menus or doing a quick settings change. But I suppose it‚Äôs a basic ‚Äî maybe I am just expecting paperwhite quality from a basic? Still, it‚Äôs wild to me that a 2024 kindle is out performed by a 2011 one ‚Äî a refurbished one at that!

If the issue worsens, or a firmware update somehow fixes things, I will update this review. But for now, all I can say is temper your expectations. I‚Äôm not sure I want to deal with another exchange (or even sure they‚Äôll do another tbh). I just want to read my books!

Otherwise, the color is cute, the size is lovely for me, and I am pleased with the rest of the promised features. The space is enough to hold my whole collection, even with my non-fiction and reference books. The contrast is good, I love the matte screen and how sharp everything looks. The lighting is much more even than my 2011 kindle has. Even with a case, it‚Äôs so light. (I am very hypermobile and even ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù things can hurt after even a short session.) I am aware eInk can ghost, based on its very nature. But again. Why is it worse in 2024 than 2011?

The Echo Pop is more compact and affordable than other Echos. It fits easily in my dorm and is easy to pack when moving between home and school.

Favorite features:
It reads my Google Calendar events to me, and I set personalized wake-up, evening, and unwind routines so that I have the external motivation to do what I need to do at the right times. I also like that I can set multiple timers/reminders without having to go on my phone, so it feels like I have a personal assistant.
I think the audio quality is pretty good as well, and I can pull-up my Spotify playlists (although if you give your playlists some complicated long name, it can be a bit harder). I usually just like to get Alexa to pull up the specific song or artist I feel like listening to at the moment and loop it though.

Improvement:
Because of school I use both Apple & Google products , and it's a bit frustrating not to be able to directly sync Alexa better with the Apple ecosystem. While it reads Google Calendar events, I'd like if Alexa could also see, create, and remind me of my Google Tasks, or do this with Apple Reminders. Currently, you'd have to check the Alexa app for notes that you create with Alexa, and there are no helpful widgets or syncing tools that work well for making this information more accessible.

Also I think the routines feature could be more flexible. Currently, if you want routines to activate at different times on weekdays versus weekends, you have to manually copy and create new routines, but I don't want the extra clutter.

Some other considerations:
Note that the Echo Pop needs to be plugged in at all times to function, so it requires setup every time you move it to a different room. I recommend getting a battery base if you want the flexibility to move it around, such as taking it to a common room or for listening to music while showering.

At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.

Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said ‚ÄúAlexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.‚Äù It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn‚Äôt necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn‚Äôt going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.

That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can‚Äôt function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn‚Äôt have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.

Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren‚Äôt exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.

I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.

One other issue is with the alarm level. I can‚Äôt seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it‚Äôs time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.

Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as ‚ÄúPeaceful Current Radio,‚Äù or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.

Update:
I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can‚Äôt match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I‚Äôm considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.

Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can‚Äôt find that in my Apple music library.

I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:
Peaceful current Radio
New Standard WNYC
IPR Studio 1
KTUX FM
KSRY FM
WJIB FM
Caf√© Del Mar Radio
Americana Boogey Radio
Aloha Joe

That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!

It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!

Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I also needed an Echo Show, so I could check my security camera feeds. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.

I've also since purchased a third Echo Pop, this one in Midnight Teal to put in my bathroom.  Sounds like a strange spot, but hear me out.  I'm an older woman who lives alone, and I subscribe to the Alexa ""Call for Help"" service, and since a slip and fall in the bathroom isn't an impossible situation, I thought it would be smart to make sure a speaker is nearby when I'm in there as well.

Update: 18.1.1 iOS did fix the issue of the not automatically pairing. I‚Äôm so happy because it has settings and shows the batter power, similar to just AirPods do.

Worth the price (on sale).,"I am a fairly heavy user of headphones and most recently have used AirPod Pro 2's.  I got the beats solo 4 on sale.

The sound is very good. The battery life is amazing. The blue color is nice. It is nice that it supports lossless audio via USB-C and also comes with both the USB-C cord and a 3.5 mm male to male cord.  They are also very light, and they charge very quickly.

They work great with Apple phones and other devices, including spatial audio. They pair easily. There isn't very much to complain about.

The only negatives that I have found so far is that it's not quite as convenient to switch between devices because it does not contain the Apple H1/H2 chip, and the clamping force of the headphones is a little too tight if you wear glasses. Hopefully that will loosen up on my particular headphones.

The lack of ANC is not a big deal. The earcups are very comfortable and they block out as much noise as a cheaper pair of ANC headphones. But, if you were looking for the sort of silence that you would receive from a more expensive pair of headphones, you probably should buy a more expensive pair of headphones.

The carrying case is nice and the headphones do fold to a fairly small size. They also seem fairly durable. The only discomfort that I have wearing them is from the clamping force; I don't know whether I have a larger small head, but I am about 6 feet tall and male. Maybe a smaller framed person would not have that difficulty.. I can wear them for a couple of hours and then it's time to give my head a rest.  I'd say for the price that I paid that is worth the trouble.

It's a common joke that beats headphones are typically found around people's necks.  I don't know whether that is true, but I can tell you that they are very comfortable around your neck. The smaller ear cups and general lightweight nature of this set of earphones make them a perfect candidate for wearing around your neck.

Finally, as a recent (and still) Apple snob, it is a little disappointing that the headphones don't know whether they are on your head or sitting on a chair, so they do not pause when you take them off.  Of course, they do not have any sort of passthrough sound capability.

If, like me, you are slightly disgusted that Apple failed to make any meaningful update to the Apple branded headphones that still cost an arm and a leg this year, these are a nice compromise, considering the price.

I saved the best for last and if you continued reading to this point, congratulations, because one of the things it is difficult to ascertain with an online purchase is microphone quality (for calls or voice recognition).  It is excellent, and the headphones sound at least as good as my AirPods Pro 2's for calls in both loud and quiet environments.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21IFUPN0YORZ9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-11-08,171.0,positive,"['perfect', 'amazing', 'great', 'life', 'durable']",0.9915,electronics

The sound quality greatly surpassed them and they fit snugly on my head. Impressed, I went on Amazon, found them at 50% off and picked them up. $200 is a bit overpriced imo for the features these include, but for $100 they're definitely worth it.

They are great for working out, a bit tight on your head, great fashion accessory, and sound fantastic for what they are especially without having noise canceling features.

The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.

These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.

Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.

Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.

The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.

Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GA8R9KQR841V,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/dc15a77a-6df7-42ca-862a-b356d5c4b842._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-10-17,105.0,positive,"['great', 'life']",0.9958,electronics

The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.

**Sound Quality:**
One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.

**Display and Design:**
The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.

**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**
As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.

**Privacy and Security:**
Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.

**Overall Performance:**
The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P2Q1EGK1FCPC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B2SBHQK,2024-08-23,57.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.999,electronics

So, I have increased from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Still not 5 stars because there is a device problem somewhere.  In addition, I believe the Echo Dot (no screen) is a better device - it ""hears"" better and has better sound.  If you run into the Echo Show going into zombie mode (where it appears to be rebooting, powering off, and repeating a doom loop over and over), try the following:

- Put it into factory default mode by holding Mute and Volume Down for 30 seconds until you see three dots appear on the screen.  It should enter setup at this point and if it works after setting it up, good.

- If you get through the setup process and parts of it repeat over and over, cycle power for one minute and try again.  This second step was necessary for me but it works now.

Thanks, Amazon support!

P L E A S E - - - READ MY EXPERIENCE UPDATE AFTER USING IT FOR 2 WKS. The disappointment started hours after plugging it in 2 Saturdays ago (Today is Dec 25th, 2023)
**UPDATE DECEMBER 25TH, 2023**

MAJOR disappointment.
It needs every subscription under the sun to enjoy 99% of it fully. Even ""Find my Phone"" is a charge! My ""Google Bot"" does not charge me for that.

It glitches a lot. In the 2 weeks it's been plugged in I've had to hard boot it 3 times.

AMAZON music sub or forget using it to play music you want. They support so many platforms... Not YouTube Red.

I bought the blink system, no pun intended, the cameras echo through the ECHO. 4 camera on sale too and so disappointed.

All games want you to pay for a service to use it fully.

No tier service plans... Just 25 bucks for this, 4.99 for that, 19.99 for this.. Like make a tier system or something.

It does not work friendly through the app or the ECHO itself. There is no way to have it on adaptive lighting and even wake it up and have the screen brighten a bit. Literally, no option for it. Like come on who can see that dark screen.. If you prompt it I should give off light.

It's not as friendly in its demeanor as ""The Google Bot"". No personality. No swearing. I asked it about a serious local news situation that the country is aware of for Vegas since the 6th of Dec, it told me ""Not sure what you're asking for"" my ""Google Bot"" gave me a 15 min break down of the first min of the horrible situation at my alma mater to the latest news. Sad.

The technology using it to do video calls, garbage. My tech abilities are expert level so no it's no my internet. My call with my mom and my husband both skipping, freezing. On their end and mine. Oh and forget adding all of your contacts.. That's a charge too. Otherwise you get 10 contacts it saves on itself only.

I'm so sad. I really was excited for this newer technology since I've had my ""Google Bot"" for six years.. It does more and knows more than this Echo.

The charges are the absolute worst for me. Find my phone? Really? Give me a break.

The speaker, not good over 50 to 60% ((60% is the highest you can go without it being tingy. I adjusted the mids, nothing changes... Even the little ask me the animal of the day if you want to keep going it does.. And shows you more animal sounds. But if you want MORE you have to pay for the service... For animal sounds..... Come on.

The smooth transition of screen to screen in where it flips through news..... Sadly lagging and skipping.

--IN CLOSING - - It's nothing of what I expected in speed. It's 6 feet from my modem.... It's not my connection...for the skipping screens. Lagging stories on the news when you ask it what's the story? Video calls... Useless. IT'S NOT even WORTH the sale price I got it for. Not even close.

The abilities it has to run your whole house, garage doors, emergency help, smoke, CO, thermostat list us longer than I've ever seen. If I can't even have me tell me what my local university updates are without it faking to even kno about it, who thinks I would roll the dice and pay all these subs and get more electronics to make the long list of things actually work.

1 star for technology for 2023
0 stars for personality, voice choice
0 stars for everything having a subscription montky cost.
0 stars for ease of use
0 stars for quality - freezing, skipping, lagging video play.
0 for sound.
0 for ease of app use with it
0 for BLINK app to use with Alexa
3 for looks, esthetic wise
2 for functions like making the screen brighter on adaptive lighting when touching it or voice prompting it
0 for cost of subs, extra gear.
1 for all it can do but at the price of each monthly cost to have them. Too afraid to buy the extras and add a subscription to it too.
4 stars for pre set up before even having it sent to me. Through email. Impressed, and that was the last time I was.
0 for more free options for even things like voices of Alexa, diff prompt names for Alexa, are all words I'd use every day but Ziggy do I went with that and still certain words I say pick it up and listen.

Overall average score for me (above stars) 2 stars all around.

Disappointed in Prime/Amazon/Amazon's Customer Service.

It's about the size of a standard alarm clock, which is too small for our kitchen.  Rather than returning it, though, I decided to keep it for the bedside table, which appears to be what it was made for.  I then ordered an Echo Show 8 for the kitchen, which is a much better size for there.

Anyway, having this on the nightstand is nice, because not only does it function as a clock, but I can ask it about the weather, the news, etc. in the morning.  The bluetooth speaker has very good sound for its size.  Overall, it's a great purchase.  Except...

It's got a couple of really annoying flaws that severely limit its usefulness.  Ugh.  Amazon, I really hope you're listening here.  At least the first of these should be fixable with a simple software update.  The second, I'm not as sure if it's a software problem or a hardware issue, but I hope that it will at least be updated by the next model.  While I'm probably not going to return this one, I can't see myself buying another one of these (or recommending it to other people) until these issues get fixed.

So, first problem... Using it as a bluetooth speaker.  I like to play music from Apple Music on my iPad, and I was hoping to use this for that.  Yes you *can* link your Apple Music account directly into the Echo Show, but that's got a couple of flaws ‚Äì first, you can't browse, you have to tell Alexa what to play, and second, if you've got your own music that you've uploaded to Apple Music because it's not in the main Apple Music library (or another app entirely), there is as far as I can tell no way to access it.  So, using the Echo Show as a bluetooth speaker it is.  Except...

Once you pair your iPad with Alexa, it will very loudly announce that it's connected.  ""Now connected to Matt's iPad"" it says very loudly.  If I had it connected previously and I start using my iPad after leaving it sit for a while (say, I was listening the night before and I pick up my iPad in the morning to glance at the news), even if I'm not playing audio, it will make the same announcement again (which, totally unexpected like that, gives me a good jump scare).  Disconnect the iPad and it makes a loud notification sound (for a while it was saying ""Disconnected from Matt's iPad"" but I seem to have managed to at least turn that off... I'm not even sure how).  It does the same if I connect and disconnect my phone.

I don't want this.  It's super annoying.  I've tried every way that I can find to turn these bluetooth announcements off, and I can't do it.  I've searched the internet and found lots of other people complaining of the same issue, but Amazon hasn't fixed it.  Some of those have suggested turning off notifications as the solution, but I've tried that (even going as far as power cycling my Echo Show to make it reboot), and I *still* get the bluetooth announcements.  They just won't go away.

So, first thing this needs before I'll give it a good rating... Amazon, please do away with these bluetooth announcements, or at least make it possible for me to disable them.  Honestly, I'd prefer not to have to completely disable notifications to do it (there's no fine grain control over notifications, it's either all on or all off, which is a problem itself), but if that's how it has to be whatever.  Just get rid of these unnecessary and annoying bluetooth announcements.

Then, there's what is actually a much bigger problem, but may require a hardware update to fix... The auto-dimming.

So, in theory, I like and want the auto-dimming feature.  I don't want this to be at full brightness all night while the room is dark.  In the dark it goes very dim, but that makes it readable in the dark without being annoying or a distraction from sleep.  That's good.

Based on how this performs, though, I have to assume that the light sensor that controls the auto-dimming is on the front and very directionally focused.  It doesn't pick up on ambient light at all.

So if I turn on the bedside lamp, which happens to be located behind the Echo Show 5 on my table?  It doesn't pick up on it, it still thinks the room is dark, and it keeps the display so dim that it's totally unreadable in the lamp light.  I use my bedside lamp a lot when I'm in the bedroom, so that is a HUGE problem.  Even if I have both the overhead light and the bedside lamp on and the screen is bright, the moment I turn the overhead light off (but leave the bedside lamp on), it goes so dark as to be unreadable.

But even when I'm using the overhead light...  If I even happen to stand or sit so that I'm positioned between the overhead light and the Echo Show unit, it dims the display.  Not nearly as dim as it goes in the dark room or with the bedside lamp, but still dim enough to make it significantly harder to read.

So basically, I can only read the screen easily with the room brightly lit or totally dark, with light directly pointed at the unit or no light at all.  Anywhere in between and it becomes unreadable.  Of course I could ""fix"" this problem by turning auto-dimming off entirely, but then it would be brightly lit all through the night.  Which I don't want either.  Right now the only setting for this is either on or off, no in-between, no adjusting the sensitivity, nothing.

So Amazon, I don't know if this means that you need more light sensors on the unit than you currently have (maybe one facing the back of the unit as well), or if it's just a software tweak to make it more (or less?  I don't even know) sensitive, but SOMETHING needs to be done about this.  A screen that I can't read isn't useful to me.

Oh, and finally, this is more minor but what is up with the white power cord on my black/""charcoal"" device?  I didn't buy a white Echo Show because I didn't want a white Echo Show.  The power cord should match the device.  Way to cheap-out, Amazon.

Fix these problems and I'll feel much better about the Echo Show 5 and happily recommend it to others as a bedside device.  With these issues, though, I'm sorry, but I can't recommend it.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRD5RSNZHTXE,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B2SBHQK,2023-07-16,488.0,positive,"['great', 'useful']",0.9953,electronics

Now the drawback (minus 1 star): It doesn't really support installing ""apps"" in the traditional sense. They are simply features. If the feature doesn't exist, you can't install it. For example, there is no YouTube functionality. Instead, when you ask Alexa to go to YouTube you'll get Amazon Silk opened to YouTube. Amazon Silk is just a web-browser and YouTube is tedious to use from a browser on such a small device.

Oh, and Amazon Silk itself is a hot piece of garbage.

On the positive side, I love that I can just add things to my shopping list as soon as I think of them. I love that I can control lights remotely so I can tell Alexa to turn lights on and off before I come home, or while I'm away.

The screen is the perfect size for me, doesn't take up too much room on the desk or nightstand, but big enough to see clearly. I experimented with the 10 inch size during one of the generation changes, but it wasn't good for my life style and home furnishings so I am back at the size I prefer.
Sound it a little better, more 3D like, but this is no comparison to a soundbar (but it CAN be linked to a soundbar or bluetooth speaker). The alexa voice is a BIG differnce, more lifelike.

I've had the display on my new Show 8 (gen. 3) stop working twice in the 3 weeks I've owned and used it. Since this is not my first Echo Show (I've owned 5 of them over the last 4 years, including the 3 I still have now), and I know this display problem is not normal. A reboot (unplugging then replugging in the electrical power) restored the display the first time. This second occurrence of the problem left me concerned: how often can I expect this issue to resurface, and does it just indicate a hardware defect in my unit? So I made the accompanying video so that you could see what I'm referring to.

It turns out that telling Alexa to ""Turn Off display"" while it's having this malfunction (while the display is black and the Display is non-responsive but while the device still responds audibly) And then saying ""Alexa"" (the wake word) restored the display and its responsiveness (to touch and verbal commands).

But I don't think that's a permanent fix.

Amazon customer support did advise toggling off the Auto Sleep setting in the device. This might be an acknowledgement of a software bug in that feature, but if it is, it's not afflicting my other Show (a current generation Show 10) that's using Auto Sleep.

Except for the above, I do like my third generation Show 8 for the quality of its sound, responsiveness, overall utility (alarms, podcast-listening, news briefs, clock, timers, display of weather conditions, calendar events, home automation of smart lights and smart plugs for fans/+, hours and phone numbers of local retailers, etc.), and the display - when it's functioning properly!

My Show 8 (gen. 3) did have one other problem during my first 3 weeks of using it: Increasingly, I needed to repeat the wake word (""Alexa"") to get the Show 8's attention. So I positioned my other Show 8 (gen. 1) near it on the same table and asked them both the same question - first the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8, then the ""gen 1"" Show 8 (which uses ""Echo"" as it's wake word). Then I listened to the Voice Activity in the Alexa app on my phone. There was considerable Distortion in the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8's recording, while the recording of the old (gen. 1) was remarkably clear. The short story is that Amazon customer support recommended the obligatory reboot, and that ""fixed"" it - for now, at least.

The ability to create routines and manage multiple devices makes it a convenient central control point for smart homes.

Alexa Features

The visual interface also allows for easy access to information and visual content, making it a great companion for daily tasks.

Video Calling and Streaming
The improved camera quality makes video calls clearer and more enjoyable. Additionally, streaming services like Prime Video and Netflix are readily accessible, and the display size is perfect for casual viewing.

I've had several devices for years, just for the fun of it, but now I truly appreciate it as a life-saving device for the elderly. It is better than wearing a life-alert pendent--which studies show that the elderly will not wear, even when they have them. My sister has early stage dementia. We are committed to helping her live independently in her own home for as long as possible.  She is always misplacing her mobile phone, and then she goes into a panic.  Alexa to the rescue.  Now, if she falls, she can merely say, ""Alexa, call for help."" or ""Alexa, call [first name] [last name].""

I got her 2 Echo Show devices: one for her bedroom and one for her living room.  Now, she can phone me through Alexa. She doesn't need to remember numbers or even operate her mobile.  I have written up commands for her to remind her that she must always say Alexa's name first.  Alexa will help her live independently and safely for longer.  The daily reminders that you can set are also important. I have set several reminders for her to take her night-time medicines.  And Alexa speaks the reminder aloud as well as shows the message on the screen.

Also, with Alexa Echo Show 5, 8, 10 etc. you can drop in on a loved one and see what's going on in their home.  It's like a nanny-cam. This is an invasion of privacy, but it essential in checking on an ill or disabled loved one, and you limit those who can drop in on you to just a few trusted caretakers and point the camera in a way to preserve personal dignity.  It gives the hearer a warning that someone is ""dropping in"" and they can block the intrusion, should they want.  I think you can drop in on the audio versions also (you just can't see anyone), but those would be appropriate in a bedroom or bath.

I'm still learning all the good things that Alexa will do.  It has a major learning curve, but once you set it up, it works beautifully--so long as your internet stays on.

Of course, adding Alexa means that big brother is watching you and listening in to your conversations.  If you watch a TV show with a character named Alexa (e.g. My Life is Murder on Acorn TV), then your device can be very annoying.  But you just say, ""Alexa, stop.""

These are small trade-offs for those of us who live alone and are getting up there in years. I'm telling everyone I meet who has an elderly parent about the importance of learning this resource.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35GXKZMLM7712,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3QJTX,2024-09-13,78.0,positive,['life'],0.9854,electronics

It is a versatile smart display that offers excellent balance between size, functionality, and price. With its 8-inch HD screen, decent audio quality, and Alexa capabilities, it makes an ideal choice for both entertainment and smart home control. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the pros and cons of the Echo Show 8, particularly focusing on its smart home integration features.

### Pros

1. **Crisp Display**: The 8-inch HD screen is a great size for viewing content, checking recipes, and video calling. The screen is clear and responsive, making it easy to navigate.

2. **Decent Audio Quality**: It has better speakers than smaller Echo devices. Its sound quality is suitable for listening to music, podcasts, and watching videos with reasonable bass and clarity.

3. **Alexa Capabilities**: With Alexa, the Echo Show 8 can manage reminders, answer questions, play music, and control smart home devices. Alexa responds quickly to voice commands and is always improving.

4. **Smart Home Integration**: It integrates well with a wide range of smart home devices. It can control lights, thermostats, security cameras, and more. The screen makes it easy to view live feeds from compatible cameras, such as Ring doorbells, giving you real-time control over your home‚Äôs security.

5. **Video Calling**: The 13 MP camera allows for clear video calling, with features such as auto-framing that keeps you centered in the shot as you move. It works with Alexa-to-Alexa calling and supports Skype and Zoom.

6. **Privacy Controls**: Amazon includes privacy features, including a physical shutter to cover the camera and options to manage microphone and camera permissions, which is reassuring for privacy-conscious users.

### Cons

1. **Screen Resolution**: While the display is HD, it‚Äôs not as sharp as some high-end tablets or competing smart displays. Some users may find it adequate for the price, but others may wish for a higher resolution.

2. **Limited App Compatibility**: The Echo Show 8 supports streaming from platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix, but it lacks native support for some other popular services, like Disney+.

3. **Occasional Lag**: Some users have reported occasional lag with certain features or apps. While it performs well for most tasks, the Echo Show 8 can feel slightly sluggish with more intensive usage.

4. **Heavy Amazon Ecosystem**: It is very much tied into the Amazon ecosystem, so users who aren‚Äôt invested in Alexa or Amazon services may find some limitations in their experience.

### Smart Home Integration

The Echo Show 8 really shines when it comes to smart home integration. Through Alexa, the device can connect to a broad array of smart home gadgets, including lights, plugs, cameras, and locks from popular brands like Philips Hue, Ring, TP-Link, and more. The screen enables unique capabilities, such as monitoring video feeds or managing device groups (e.g., turning off all lights in one room with a single command). Additionally, Alexa routines allow you to automate complex tasks across multiple devices, making it easy to personalize your home automation.

### Verdict

The Amazon Echo Show 8 is a strong choice for anyone looking to add a smart display to their home. It‚Äôs reasonably priced, offers solid performance, and integrates well with most smart home systems. While it‚Äôs not without its drawbacks, particularly regarding screen resolution and app limitations, the device remains a valuable addition to a connected home. Whether you‚Äôre new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, the Echo Show 8 offers a great balance of features and value.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJW9GGJXX70AX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3Y632,2024-10-29,3.0,positive,"['great', 'versatile']",0.9989,electronics

The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.

**Sound Quality:**
One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.

**Display and Design:**
The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.

**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**
As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.

**Privacy and Security:**
Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.

**Overall Performance:**
The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J1CVS95RNQ3J,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3Y632,2024-10-07,0 people found this helpful,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.999,electronics

All of my adult life I have made do with hand-me-down or used TVs/monitors.

My dead TV was set up in my office so I could watch TV while working on the computer. I fed the TV with a laptop, via HDMI. I had previously poured a giant glass of ice-water on the laptop so the screen doesn't work very well, which made it perfect for feeding the TV.

I have large VOD libraries on both Prime Video and Vudu, so when looking at the Smart TV options, access to Vudu is important to me. So I originally decided against this TV because it's an Amazon Fire TV, and my Fire Tablet, (that I use to watch TV/movies in bed), doesn't allow me to put Vudu on it.

But when looking at all of the options, this one was the right size, and it does have HDMI inputs, so I could still feed it with my broken laptop, so it was the obvious choice, with the great sale price.

I searched the apps and found that Vudu was an option. I also downloaded Peacock, Paramount+, Movies Anywhere, Tubi, Plex, Crackle, MSNBC, The CW, ABC, NBC, CBS, and YouTube. Signing into to each of them on my computer and using codes worked really well. So the only thing I had to actually type my password into using the remote was my Wifi. It all works great, and switching to the HDMI input is easy, if I ever want or need to do that. Like if I ever want to watch something I only have on DVD or Blu Ray.

I will add Disney+, Hulu and Netflix when the WGA writer's strike is over and I resubscribe to them.

I don't know if my previous TV was HD, but when I've visited my parents when they've played Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and other things in HD on their HD TV and it has all looked gross. The Battle of Helms Deep was a bunch of amorphous clay blobs, and the Death Star was a bunch of dudes in bad costumes hanging out. I don't know if that was the motion smoothing thing that Tom Cruise was mad about a few years back, Either way, I've seen none of that gross stuff.

I've watch a little of the new Children of the Corn, several episodes of Stargate Atlantis, a little of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and Jurassic Park, and it all looks good. If I look closely I can see what I'm guessing is filmgrain, but the picture is clear.

I recently watched an episode of Snoops (1999) that was uploaded to YouTube from probably VHS. There's a brief scene that features Dick Miller. I posted a screenshot to Twitter, but anyone who looked at that pic has to more or less take my word for it that it is indeed Dick Miller. But on this TV I could make guesses about the shade of lipstick worn by Teyla Emmagan, if I knew anything about lipstick.

This is all to let you know my level of knowledge so you can judge how my level of happiness would measure up to your level of happiness.

My only other observation in the few hours I've had this, is that the TV stands are at the outer edges of the TV. My previous TV had a big center stand, when meant I could perch it fairly near the edge of the table next to my desk, at a 45 degree angle (ish). So with the stands at the edges, I've had to push the TV farther back, and put sturdy things under the stands to give the TV better purchase on the table. Which is to say, you really need enough table under the entire TV to support it.

I saw a review that said their TV didn't come with the screws for the stands. Mine did. They were in a separate small bad, the same way the remote batteries were in a separate bag.

So far the TV seems absolutely great.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SOW75IV84B9D,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/61c9f9b2-832f-4ff2-bc5d-0c27186e748c._CR0,0,343,343_SX48_.jpg",True,B09ZLTMWWH,2023-07-01,950.0,negative,[],-0.7714,electronics

The 720p picture is quite good, no need for 1080p for a 32"" TV.  The native Fire TV app is a bit sluggish when compared to the Fire TV Stick 4k's and the 2nd & 3rd gen Cubes I own, but it is acceptable.

It has quite a few inputs for a TV at this price.  I even connected a ROKU Express 4K+ to one of the HDMI outputs and it works great, even snappier than the native Fire TV app.  I also ran a coaxial outside antenna connection and the TV's tuner picked up all of the available stations in my area without issue.

I connected an old VCR to the TV‚Äôs composite audio/video inputs and the picture & sound is quite good (as can be expected.)

It would be nice if the TV had a selectable input or the option to default to the last used input when powered on.  It always defaults to its own Fire TV app.

I expected the TV to have lousy sound, but it is surprisingly good.  Plenty loud enough with a full sound.

Internal storage is good, I was able to install quite a few apps without running out of space.  However, when I was notified that my DirecTV streaming app had an update, the Fire TV app said there wasn‚Äôt enough room to install it.

The user interface is intuitive and adding and rearranging the apps is supper simple.  Like all smart tvs, you search for your app. Add it and sign in.  To rearrange you click on the app you want to move and then use the remote to reorder.  Super intuitve.

Picture and color.
 It's a small tv and as such the clarity is great.  Pixl people understand.  Ther are several options foradjustments for viewing the picture, standard, movie, dynamic... I like mine set to movie.  I just watch tv and find that this setting is dark and rich.  Gamers would chose differently, I'm sure.  There is also the option to fine tune the pictures contrast, brightness....I found the factory choice of settings to be the best quality.  Resetting back to factory was a a button option on the same screen which took the fear factor of making adjustments out of the equation.

Sound
I was very surprised at how powerful the speaker were. I thought I would need a sound bar and expected to have to crank up the volume but alas I use a low sound settin.  I am watching from across the room and am hard of hearing.  Impressive.

Voice activated remote:
I didn't think much of this and never thought I'd use it.  I am now hooked and use it A LOT!

Conclusion:
I am so pleased with this tv sound and picture quality.  The housing of the tv is not at all premium and is in fact toy like.  For me the aesthetics is not an issue.  I am watching this from across the room as a bedroom tv.  For a secondary tv, THIS ROCKS!  I paid $69 for it.  Anything over $100 would be too much. for this pint sized television.

Worth the price (on sale).,"I am a fairly heavy user of headphones and most recently have used AirPod Pro 2's.  I got the beats solo 4 on sale.

The sound is very good. The battery life is amazing. The blue color is nice. It is nice that it supports lossless audio via USB-C and also comes with both the USB-C cord and a 3.5 mm male to male cord.  They are also very light, and they charge very quickly.

They work great with Apple phones and other devices, including spatial audio. They pair easily. There isn't very much to complain about.

The only negatives that I have found so far is that it's not quite as convenient to switch between devices because it does not contain the Apple H1/H2 chip, and the clamping force of the headphones is a little too tight if you wear glasses. Hopefully that will loosen up on my particular headphones.

The lack of ANC is not a big deal. The earcups are very comfortable and they block out as much noise as a cheaper pair of ANC headphones. But, if you were looking for the sort of silence that you would receive from a more expensive pair of headphones, you probably should buy a more expensive pair of headphones.

The carrying case is nice and the headphones do fold to a fairly small size. They also seem fairly durable. The only discomfort that I have wearing them is from the clamping force; I don't know whether I have a larger small head, but I am about 6 feet tall and male. Maybe a smaller framed person would not have that difficulty.. I can wear them for a couple of hours and then it's time to give my head a rest.  I'd say for the price that I paid that is worth the trouble.

It's a common joke that beats headphones are typically found around people's necks.  I don't know whether that is true, but I can tell you that they are very comfortable around your neck. The smaller ear cups and general lightweight nature of this set of earphones make them a perfect candidate for wearing around your neck.

Finally, as a recent (and still) Apple snob, it is a little disappointing that the headphones don't know whether they are on your head or sitting on a chair, so they do not pause when you take them off.  Of course, they do not have any sort of passthrough sound capability.

If, like me, you are slightly disgusted that Apple failed to make any meaningful update to the Apple branded headphones that still cost an arm and a leg this year, these are a nice compromise, considering the price.

I saved the best for last and if you continued reading to this point, congratulations, because one of the things it is difficult to ascertain with an online purchase is microphone quality (for calls or voice recognition).  It is excellent, and the headphones sound at least as good as my AirPods Pro 2's for calls in both loud and quiet environments.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21IFUPN0YORZ9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-11-08,171.0,positive,"['perfect', 'amazing', 'great', 'life', 'durable']",0.9915,electronics

They are great for working out, a bit tight on your head, great fashion accessory, and sound fantastic for what they are especially without having noise canceling features.

The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.

These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.

Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.

Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.

The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.

Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GA8R9KQR841V,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/dc15a77a-6df7-42ca-862a-b356d5c4b842._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-10-17,105.0,positive,"['great', 'life']",0.9958,electronics

Design: I honestly fell in love with the design. I think it's very modern and the way it incorporates the clock with the speaker is very well done.

Sound: I'm honestly impressed by the sound quality. It is very loud, crisp and clear. It isn't the ABSOLUTE loudest or best speaker out there, however, it performs incredibly well. The bass very good and very present for such a small device.

Alexa: The Alexa feature on it is amazing. Very versatile with what you can do with it and it's very responsive as well. I love that you can control so many things with it if you have the right accessories.

Screen: At first glance I though the whole top portion was a screen, but it's only a small square in the center. The screen itself is very bright and pleasing to look at. Touch screen is very responsive and decently customizable, from color to clock format, but I wish it had a few more options for how you want the clock to look like, though, it's not an issue at all.

Connectivity: Very seamless and easy to handle with your phone (Alexa App). There are many options on how to use your Echo Spot and though I've only gone through a few, I've seen the rest of the things I can use the app for, and it is so versatile. I'm sure WiFi connectivity matters when it comes to response time between your phone and the Echo, but the response time was very quick in my experience.

Cord: It brings a decently long cord. Would be nice if the plug was a bit less bulky, but again, minor inconvenience, not an issue at all.

Overall, this is a solid product and I highly reccomend it if you've never had one. I did buy it with a few things in mind though.

Also, the sound quality on these is pretty good considering the cost. Sound quality isn't JBL Charge level good but it's definitely better than phone speakers. They are loud, clear, and even have eq settings you can set through the app. You can even set these Echos up to play music through all of your Amazon related devices at the same time which can be useful and save you a ton of money.

Prior to purchasing these gadgets, I read mixed reviews on a lot of the things I mentioned, but I haven't experienced any issues. Some of the settings can be a pain to find, but overall, the app will walk you through setup step by step what you need to do to get them working and connected to your wifi. If you have connection issues, you need to check your network settings or your wifi range.

My 2 complaints are, 1) the devices came caked in dust even though the box was sealed; and 2) the buttons could feel a little higher quality. I don't use the buttons at all due to voice commands and control through the app, but that may be an issue for some users.

Something else I noticed was the horrible reviews linking the devices to Spotify. I didn't have these reported issues myself, so they could've been fixed with a firmware update, but it's definitely worth mentioning.

I feel like a lot of these issues people are having are either network issues, or user related issues. If you take your time and follow the on-screen instructions, you won't have any issues.

The display, it is great, way better than I though, it looks tiny in the pictures but in real life the screen is actually pretty large! In full light the bezel makes it look like the full upper half is a screen. I like that it shows the date, time, and weather on the screen, and how the display goes to a red at night if you have night mode enabled, it is way less bright then.

2 common complaints I don't have.

‚Ä¢ Doesn't default to homescrewn when playing music, well it is meant for your night stand where you are 2 feet away from it, you would be able to see the small clock, if you need it to go to the home screen just say ""Alexa, go home.""

The first round Echo Spot was neat but painfully slow, and also tried to fit a square UI in a round space.

So I switched to the 5in Show...which was a mistake. While the device is nice, it often failed to switch to ""night mode"" which meant it was a blazing beacon next to my bed all night. But what was worse was how it would cycle to ads or information often and then hide the time in the corner, which is what I wanted it for. I moved it to an office where it worked better.

This is the best one because it solves almost all the 5 shows problems. First off: NO ADS. No random cycling on the screen, it just shows the time. It's exactly what I wanted.

Second, it has a much better night mode. Not only does it actually fire off, it changes the time to red (which doesn't impar night vision) which is fantastic.

Next, no camera. It can't spy on you. Thank goodness.

Lastly, the it still does screen features (it's a touchscreen). Stuff like timers can still show, your next alarm can show, and you can adjust alarms with the touch features.

I do have a few minor gripes. The sound quality is just...passable, not incredible, but honestly Echo devices across the board have had dimishing sound quality with each new iteration. On that same note, I swear Alexa is getting dumber every update. Luckily I mostly just build my own routines for smart home stuff and thus don't ask her very many questions, but even getting her to recognize simple commands has become less reliable.

Regardless, if you have a smart home and need a voice device in your bedroom and also want a clock this one is great.

When it gets closer to its own set time of 6:39 it happens again and adds another 9 minutes to the alarm time. This happens continuously for a hour and 20 minutes so an alarm I set for 6:30 AM goes off at 7:50 AM. This is unacceptable. A alarm clock that you can‚Äôt depend on is worthless.

I called Amazon tech services and they had me reset the Spot back to factory settings and set it up again. Then we tested it by setting alarm for 2 minutes ahead and it worked so we thought it was fixed. So the next day I set the alarm for 6:30 AM weekdays and this morning it went off at 7:50 AM. Junk !!! I‚Äôve checked everything in the Alexa app and have tried setting the 6:30 AM alarm up using the app as well setting by voice. It doesn‚Äôt matter the 6:30 AM alarm goes off at 7:50 AM.

I give up and returning this worthless alarm clock.

Update: Amazon Outreach Department contacted me about the problems we were having with the Echo Spot alarm. It seems some other people were having the same problem. We run fans at night and the Echo Spot tap feature was on. They asked me to turn off the tap feature in the Alexa app. We did and now the alarm has worked perfectly ever since.

They said there seems to be a correlation between fans running and the tap feature on causing the Spot to reset the set alarm time into snooze mode automatically.

We have a 2nd Echo Spot which wasn‚Äôt set up for an alarm so I tested it. On Monday I set its alarm for 7:30 AM with the tap feature on and the bedroom fans on.
Sure enough the alarm failed and it set itself on snooze mode for over 30 minutes.
So on Tuesday I set the alarm for 7:30 AM with the tap feature off and the fans running. It worked perfectly and went off at exactly 7:30 AM and no snooze problems. Problems solved !!

I don‚Äôt care if the tap feature is off in the Alexa app, just tell it to snooze by voice and it works perfectly and only snoozes for 9 minutes.

I have reported my findings to Amazon as they are working to figure out why this is happening. There seems to be a correlation between the tap feature on and fans running in the room.

Anyway the Spot alarm works perfectly now on both Spots and we love the Echo Spot now and everything it does.

I want to thank Amazon for actually caring and reaching out to me and working together to fix this alarm problem.

The basic kindle is great to hold onto for hours at a time. It‚Äôs weighs very little, and I love the bezel.

I don‚Äôt miss the waterproofing because I don‚Äôt usually take my kindle anywhere near the water. (And if it does get wet it‚Äôs not too expensive to replace.)

Prior to that I had the basic kindle from 2019. While I love the paperwhite and its features, I quickly found that it can be fairly uncomfortable and awkward to hold compared to my old 6 inch kindle. It is also noticeably heavier.

I ultimately decided to purchase this new kindle and as soon as I took it out of the box I knew I made the right call. I purchased the matcha color, which I was hesitant to do because I didn‚Äôt really love how it looked in the pictures but also didn‚Äôt want just plain black. I am SO glad I chose the matcha. It isn‚Äôt as vibrant as it appears in the ad photos which I really like. It is very similar to the agave green paperwhite color. I also love that the whole device is the same color rather than just the back being colored.

As for the page turning speed, I don‚Äôt see much of a difference between this kindle and the previous paperwhite model. The page turning wasn‚Äôt something that ever bothered me, but they really emphasized this ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù in the advertising so I was hoping for more. But again, certainly not a deal breaker for me.

In terms of the difference in features between this model and the paperwhite, I don‚Äôt feel as though I am missing out on much. The one feature I would have loved to see on this kindle that the paperwhite has is the adjustable warmth of the screen color.

Overall, I definitely think that I will be reaching for this kindle more than the paperwhite given how compact and light this model is.

I also have a 2024 Kobo Clara and there is very little difference in the two devices - the lighting is good on both, the weight is very slightly less on the Kindle, although not by enough to matter, and the speed is equivalent on both devices.

As far as usability, the Kindle is locked to Amazon's system, so if you get books from Google, Kobo, or Barnes and Noble, you won't be able to read them on this device without stripping the DRM, which is illegal. That said, you can borrow books from your local library if you first go to the library web page and check the book out. Then you designate that you want to read it on your Kindle and link your Amazon account, at which time it will show up in your books. On the Kobo Clara, you can browse and borrow books directly from the library, which I find more convenient.

Battery life on the two devices seems comparable as well. I have not seen a measurable difference when reading with the wifi turned off (unless I'm syncing, I have it turned off) Page turns also seem identical, which is a big improvement over the older Paperwhite I had before. The home screen and settings are easier to use and navigate on the Kobo Clara, but if you are used to the Kindle interface, nothing will have changed. It looks much the same as my very old Kindle Touch.

This device does not have page turn buttons (neither does the Kobo Clara BW) so if you want that feature, you'll have to get the more expensive models, but both have USB C charging via cable, which is nice. I can finally recycle the last of the old charging cables! You cannot service any aspect of this reader, which is not a huge problem for me, but I still think owners should be able to replace batteries or screens on devices that come with a price tag like this, but that's another discussion entirely. For what it's worth, the Kobo Clara is user-serviceable, just sayin'!

Cost-wise, I chose the Kindle over the Paperwhite because I did not see the value in spending that much more for a few minor features. The screen resolution is fantastic and the size makes it far more portable than the larger Paperwhite. Even with the case on, I can fit this into a back pocket or jacket pocket easily.

Overall, this is a solid choice for an e-reader, although I find that since I get books from different places, having two devices is required (Kindle for Amazon books, Kobo for all other sources) If you want the specific features the Paperwhite has, are OK with paying that much more for them, this might not be the choice for you.

It is still going strong, but with its lack of space after 10+ years of collecting books, and upgrades in screen quality on new devices, I was ready to upgrade. When I saw this new basic release, I was excited! I really wanted the agave paperwhite se, but I felt I could not justify the price tag with my ‚Äúancient‚Äù kindle still working well. (It just couldn‚Äôt hold many books! And the lag and crashes were getting annoying.) Along comes this basic and I think for that price, why not try it out?

Well, the first one arrives and the ghosting is pretty bad. Customer service did their best but we decided to exchange it. I was assured the replacement would NOT ghost. Got the replacement today and sadly there is still a little ghosting‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs barely there. I‚Äôm worried it will become worse as I use it. So far the book pages refresh well enough that it isn‚Äôt a noticeable issue while reading, but it gets irritating when I am navigating menus or doing a quick settings change. But I suppose it‚Äôs a basic ‚Äî maybe I am just expecting paperwhite quality from a basic? Still, it‚Äôs wild to me that a 2024 kindle is out performed by a 2011 one ‚Äî a refurbished one at that!

If the issue worsens, or a firmware update somehow fixes things, I will update this review. But for now, all I can say is temper your expectations. I‚Äôm not sure I want to deal with another exchange (or even sure they‚Äôll do another tbh). I just want to read my books!

Otherwise, the color is cute, the size is lovely for me, and I am pleased with the rest of the promised features.

The lighting is much more even than my 2011 kindle has. Even with a case, it‚Äôs so light. (I am very hypermobile and even ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù things can hurt after even a short session.)

This is my first Kindle, so I don‚Äôt have any other Kindle to compare it to. I usually read a physical book, books on my Computer, IPad or iPhone. This Kindle makes a difference in my ability to relax while reading a book. It is an awesome device that is portable, light weight, and convenient.

Although I like reading on my IPad, it will no longer be my go to device for reading (When you know better, you do better).

My house is full of unread books that I bought over the years, and that really bothers me because I just couldn‚Äôt find the time to read (being a professor with lots of other academic books to read, I gave those academic books priority over a good novel). Now, I am at the point where I want to read books for relaxation purposes. I chose the Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition as part of my incentive to read a good book.

I researched this Kindle for an entire month before investing in it.

Let‚Äôs get to the workings of the Kindle:

This 7 inch Kindle is easy to hold in my hands. The IPad truly strained my hand when I tried to use only one hand when reading. At times, I had to lean the IPad on my thighs for support. Now, there will be no more hand to thighs when reading!

The Kindle set up was very easy, and user friendly. I did not experience any problems connecting to the internet.

After set up, with bated breath, I waited to see how the pages turned on the Kindle, and if I will find any fault with the action of turning the pages of the book I was reading. I am happy to say there was none; no noticeable long lag time, no problems were experienced with the turning of pages on this Kindle.

Then I squinted my eyes, opened my eyes wide, I turned the Kindle upside down, and side to side while turning to the next page of  my book; I was trying to see if there will be any trace of the previous page as I turn to the next page ( ghosting; some users experience an imprint of the former page while moving to the next page of their book). Happy to report, I tried hard to find a problem with that but I found none.

What about the battery?
The battery charged very quickly, and there was no problem during that process. I did charge the battery with the case on the Kindle, (as the picture shows). The Kindle came with an 80% charge and in 30 minutes (or less) it was fully charged (100%).

I am hardly ever swayed by reviews:
Sometimes reviews work as an incentive, or a deterrent‚Ä¶.I always say, try an item out and make your personal decision.
This Kindle is a keeper, and I am also going to purchase the new Color Kindle Colorsoft.

Conclusion:
This Kindle paper white Signature Edition , Gen 12/32 GB, is truly made for reading. It is certainly a handy device for traveling, and reading on the go. It is easy on the eyes, and therefore, easy on the brain. The raspberry color is really nice, and I plan on buying an extra clear case so that I could easily see the vibrant color of the kindle.

I am honestly excited to be part of the Kindle family!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E96RK60QWPS0,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0C8RR4WN3,2024-11-05,135.0,positive,[],0.9957,electronics

It brings to mind another device that featured strikingly good sharpness and contrast despite the layers over the screen: The Voyage. I don't have one on hand to do a direct comparison, but it certainly seems to have that same sort of secret sauce going for it. I'll be very interested to see some direct comparisons from people who still have a Voyage on hand. It's not as apparent in photos, but I'm surprised at how much sharper it is than my 2021 PW. I knew from the early reviews that it would be better, but I wasn't expecting it to be so noticeable. Even my beloved Oasis comes up short in a direct comparison!

Much has been made of the speed of this iteration of the PW, and it's not just empty hype. I never thought the word ""fast"" would ever really apply to an e-ink screen due to the limitations of the technology, but the Kindle team has made that a reality. Pages turn as quickly as I can tap the screen, and while I've never cried out to the heavens about page turns being too slow, it's impressive to see such responsiveness on an e-ink screen. The true benefits of this speed come into play when navigating menus, adjusting settings, and especially when typing. I honestly did not think it was possible for an e-ink screen to be so fast and responsive. This is truly impressive. The speed in itself is not a reason to upgrade to this model, but if you're already considering an upgrade, it is definitely an extra enticement.

Despite the larger screen, it's very nearly the same size, measuring about a millimeter taller and wider. Annoyingly, it's just enough that the device won't fit in cases made for the 2021 model. (At least, neither of the ones I have.)

The back of the device feels very similar, just a bit slick. I still have no difficulty holding onto it. The power button is still on the bottom, and though I understand why some are annoyed by this, it's never been an issue for me. I've been using Kindles for thirteen years, and while about five of those saw me primarily using an Oasis, that's still a good eight years I used various basic and PW models. In all that time, I don't recall ever pressing the power button by mistake. So I get why it's a point of irritation for some, but it's not a mark against the device for me.

I have a Colorsoft on order, and this PW was intended as an early Xmas gift for my mom. While I set it up for her, I just couldn't resist playing around with it a bit, and it has really won me over. If I wind up not keeping my Colorsoft, I'll definitely be getting one of these for myself. The improvements are mostly small, but those little things add up to a noticeably superior experience. Despite the lack of page turn buttons, which I truly love, it just may supplant my Oasis as my main reader!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGICHT7FOSW8G,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/0776b7ff-a403-41ed-a182-e2b5e73672f1._CR0,0,436,436_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CFPP8C33,2024-10-20,219.0,positive,['love'],0.9983,electronics

QC is garbage! Return process the worst in the Industry,"Shopping for a new Kindle is like playing Russian roulette. You‚Äôre taking a huge gamble, taking on a big risk because the quality control is absolute garbage now at Amazon. Amazon is literally going backwards with the Kindle. This is my second Paperwhite and it‚Äôs even worse than the first. I figured why not take another chance on the premium Kindle Paperwhite signature edition thinking that it‚Äôll somehow be better, not the case. It‚Äôs even worse than the standard Paperwhite which was really bad to begin with. As a comparison, I have my Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation from 2015 that is leaps and bounds much better than this garbage new edition.

Now for a little background‚Ä¶

I have owned every Kindle starting from 2014 when I got the Voyage. Right off the bat the new Kindle Paperwhite has an overly yellow screen, meaning that the light is significantly yellow. It‚Äôs not white, it‚Äôs not even subtly opaque. But YELLOW! To make things worse, the screen lighting isn‚Äôt even even. It‚Äôs has a darker yellow band towards the bottom of the screen. This is not only my device, but across the board. This is confirmed across multiple websites, including YouTube and Amazon reviews on here. So the lighting issues not only affect the new Kindle Colorsoft, which is getting absolutely flamed for the same issue, but it also affects the new Paperwhite.

The other issue is that all new Kindles no longer support Apple computers due to the new MTP format that the Kindles are using. This means that you have to go through the hassle of downloading a third-party application to do simple things like update new software and side-load fonts.

Which leads me to my next issue, side-loaded fonts are no longer properly supported. You can still side-load fonts BUT every time you open a new book, it automatically defaults to the Bookerly font, even though you have saved a certain font setting. This is extremely annoying!

The next issue is that you can no longer download and transfer a book through the content settings on the Amazon website with new Kindles. If you want to download a book that you have purchased, Amazon has eliminated the ability for you to do that. WHY???
Amazon service has no answers regarding this.

Needless to say I returned this device for all of the stated reasons and guess what!?! Amazon is going to take 30 DAYS to refund me my money! I have to wait 30 DAYS to get my money back because Amazon has a defective and unsatisfactory faulty device. Not only that, but I have to make sure that somebody is home because the only return option is UPS pick up. You can no longer have the convenience of dropping it off at your local UPS store, Kohl‚Äôs or Staples. Only UPS pick up!!! Maddening! Next time if I ever purchase another Kindle, it will not be through Amazon. But yet, if new Kindles are this bad, why bother!

Now let‚Äôs talk about aesthetics and design. It seems Amazon is going backwards in their hardware. The voyage was released 10 years ago in 2014 and if you were to compare them side-by-side, one would think that the Voyage is the brand new model. Aside from the having micro USB, the Voyage has a sleeker, more premium look with page turn sensors and better materials with a micro etched glass screen instead of plastic. It also has a curved symmetrical design for better feel as opposed to a basic slab like the new Paperwhite.

Lastly, Amazon has done absolutely NOTHING to improve their software. You still have the same limitations that you did since day one. Kindles have the same limited margin settings, limited font size settings, and limited line-spacing settings.

I have a lot of side-loaded fonts that I would like to use but am unable to because they‚Äôre either too big or too small with the slightest increment in size adjustment. Absolutely ridiculous! Also, the boldness options are too thick, with slightest adjustment a font will go from too thin to too bold. A total joke!

GIVE US MORE FONT SIZES and OPTIONS AMAZON!

Needless to say, a complete NIGHTMARE!

That said, this is like a portable paperback book that is comfortable to hold with one hand and the Enjoyment of reading is unparalleled.  I have tried Kobo and even own a boox note air 4c and while each of those are great at some things, this has the whole package.  For comics I use my boox note air 4c, but the dictionary on the kindle is the best!  Adding a dictionary to kobo and boox can be done, but not the oxford concise like on the kindle.  On Boox you have to get the app, copy the word go to the app and look it up.  That is better than kobo where I had to go to my phone or paperback dictionary.  Anyway a good dictionary is a must and kindle has the whole package.  I could take a star away for the closed echo system of amazon as I would like to be able to put them on my kobo or boox devices directly, but I also want authors to get paid and I actually am ok with drm.

Admittedly, I don‚Äôt know much about the device, as I previously ordered ebooks from their competitors and I use a service for the blind available to me for audio books. I did some research before buying and learned of the accessibility features on the kindle, which is of utmost importance to me. I went with this version (paper-white SE) for the auto adjustable lighting and wireless charging (which I have not used yet, but plan to in the future).

As previously mentioned, I ‚Äúread‚Äù ebooks purchased from other sources and used my iPad which has a ‚Äúread to me‚Äù feature. The kindle offers a VoiceOver option, but it is not as great as the iPad feature. The number one annoyance I have with the Kindle is the non disability friendly Home Screen. WHY is enlargement and font size not accessible on the Home Screen? For someone with vision loss like myself, I can‚Äôt read anything on the main page. This is also the same struggle with the Settings page. Being able to enlarge the screen and change (or bold) the font would be helpful on the Settings screen too.  However, once I get to a book, the accessibility features such as enlarge print, spacing, etc, are acceptable and functional. I would hope products like the Kindle are evaluated and tested for wide consumer use. The blind and low vision community likes to read too, and we can, using technology which I hoped was already integrated on the device.

Moving on from accessibility, the device is lightweight, slim, and easy to carry. It even fit - with a case - in my Lululemon 2L belt bag without issue! I used it without a case for a few weeks and it was easy to hold, though did leave fingerprints on the backing (easily removed with a microfiber towel). Charging time varies, though the battery life is exceptional, having not charged for a week and not even down to half the battery. The screen moves flawlessly- most of the time, though there have been a few instances where the screen moves flawlessly ‚Äúglitched/jumped‚Äù and refreshed. It‚Äôs a split second annoyance, but otherwise it‚Äôs fine almost all of the time. Other than a case with ‚Äúwake‚Äù features, I wish I could touch screen to go from the book cover back to the book without having to push the button on the bottom of the device.

All in all, I am happy to be a new member of the Kindle family, but hope their next model is a little more advanced in accessibility features.

I really like the experience of reading without a light shining in my eyes. When it is too dark to read, I like that I can change the brightness and color temperature of the light. I can take all of my books and audiobooks with me wherever I go. It‚Äôs light so it doesn‚Äôt bother my hands if I read for a long time. I like its size. However, it‚Äôs not perfect. I have some issues with the software and the hardware:

Software:

Clunky: The user interface feels very unpolished, clunky, cluttered, unintuitive, and not user friendly. It‚Äôs a mess. I wish there was a Home Screen with a Kindle app, an Audible app, a documents app, a browser app, a store, and a settings app. Instead, we have one cobbled together monstrosity trying to be all of those things at once. All of my audible books, documents, and kindle books are thrown together and you have to set filters to find things. You can set up collections but you can‚Äôt put audiobooks into collections so they clutter up the ‚Äúuncollected‚Äù folder. The OS just feels lazy, like they didn‚Äôt put much thought or care into the user experience. The swiping gestures also feel unintuitive.
Translation: I am learning a foreign language and most of what I read is in that language. When I come across a word I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs nice having the ability to translate that word right on the device. However, every time I need to translate a word, I have to select the word, then Wikipedia will show up then I have to scroll over to translate, then select the language menu, scroll through the list to find the language, select it, and finally I get the translation. I wish I could either get rid of Wikipedia or move it so the first thing that pops up is translation. I want to be able to download the language I am translating for use offline and delete the others from the list of available translation languages. The language detection feature rarely works. I just want to select the word and immediately see what it means.

Hardware:
Power button: Why in the world did they put the power button on the bottom of the device? This has become really bothersome. My pinky naturally rests right where the button is and the screen has turned off many times. It also means I can‚Äôt rest the device on my knee or other surface while reading.
Charging light: It‚Äôs on the bottom next to the USB-C charging port. The issue is that I read before bed so I charge it on my nightstand. The light illuminates the room which is annoying. I‚Äôd rather just have a charging symbol show up on the screen.
Material: The material feels like plastic. I read that the regular Kindle Paperwhite comes with a softer material, which I want. I paid more and feel like I got a downgrade in this area.

Also, I don‚Äôt understand why people are so upset about the lack of buttons. I love that this doesn‚Äôt have buttons.

The Echo Pop is more compact and affordable than other Echos. It fits easily in my dorm and is easy to pack when moving between home and school.

Favorite features:
It reads my Google Calendar events to me, and I set personalized wake-up, evening, and unwind routines so that I have the external motivation to do what I need to do at the right times. I also like that I can set multiple timers/reminders without having to go on my phone, so it feels like I have a personal assistant.
I think the audio quality is pretty good as well, and I can pull-up my Spotify playlists (although if you give your playlists some complicated long name, it can be a bit harder). I usually just like to get Alexa to pull up the specific song or artist I feel like listening to at the moment and loop it though.

Improvement:
Because of school I use both Apple & Google products , and it's a bit frustrating not to be able to directly sync Alexa better with the Apple ecosystem. While it reads Google Calendar events, I'd like if Alexa could also see, create, and remind me of my Google Tasks, or do this with Apple Reminders. Currently, you'd have to check the Alexa app for notes that you create with Alexa, and there are no helpful widgets or syncing tools that work well for making this information more accessible.

Also I think the routines feature could be more flexible. Currently, if you want routines to activate at different times on weekdays versus weekends, you have to manually copy and create new routines, but I don't want the extra clutter.

Some other considerations:
Note that the Echo Pop needs to be plugged in at all times to function, so it requires setup every time you move it to a different room. I recommend getting a battery base if you want the flexibility to move it around, such as taking it to a common room or for listening to music while showering.

At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.

Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said ‚ÄúAlexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.‚Äù It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn‚Äôt necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn‚Äôt going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.

That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can‚Äôt function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn‚Äôt have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.

Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren‚Äôt exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.

I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.

One other issue is with the alarm level. I can‚Äôt seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it‚Äôs time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.

Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as ‚ÄúPeaceful Current Radio,‚Äù or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.

Update:
I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can‚Äôt match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I‚Äôm considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.

Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can‚Äôt find that in my Apple music library.

I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:
Peaceful current Radio
New Standard WNYC
IPR Studio 1
KTUX FM
KSRY FM
WJIB FM
Caf√© Del Mar Radio
Americana Boogey Radio
Aloha Joe
Quiet Village Radio
WSBZ FM
Smooth Jazz 101

That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!

It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!

Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I also needed an Echo Show, so I could check my security camera feeds. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.

I've also since purchased a third Echo Pop, this one in Midnight Teal to put in my bathroom.  Sounds like a strange spot, but hear me out.  I'm an older woman who lives alone, and I subscribe to the Alexa ""Call for Help"" service, and since a slip and fall in the bathroom isn't an impossible situation, I thought it would be smart to make sure a speaker is nearby when I'm in there as well.  Plus, the Midnight Teal is an almost exact match for the color scheme in that room, so clearly this is meant to be.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAZDNZHIEAFX1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09WNK39JN,2024-07-19,3.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect', 'love', 'life']",0.9973,electronics

Here were the results:

Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Pros ‚Äì These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.
Cons ‚Äì The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn‚Äôt care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter ‚Äúb‚Äù in the middle.

Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Pros ‚Äì Very comfortable with the same great physically ‚Äúclicky‚Äù buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.
Cons ‚Äì Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Pros ‚Äì A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.
Cons ‚Äì Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn‚Äôt stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.

Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Pros ‚Äì Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.
Cons ‚Äì Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn‚Äôt stay in if I turned my head too fast.

Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
Pros ‚Äì Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn‚Äôt open accidentally.
Cons ‚Äì This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a ‚Äúflayed‚Äù shape rather than the ‚Äúrounded‚Äù shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.

My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn‚Äôt realize how desperately I needed.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUUJJA0TERA67,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B096SV8SJG,2022-08-11,2.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.9985,electronics

They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.

For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features  I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.
Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world‚Äî they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.

‚ÄîTHE SOUND‚Äî
Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!

‚ÄîCONNECTIVITY‚Äî
These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don‚Äôt need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.

‚ÄîFIT‚Äî
The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)

‚ÄîTHE CONTROLS‚Äî
The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.
The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON‚Ä¶ which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.
While these do have a very sensitive physical button‚Äî it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.

‚ÄîBATTERY‚Äî
The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?

‚ÄîRANGE‚Äî
Very good, about 30+ feet

‚ÄîCONS‚Äî
-no MagSafe compatible charging
-fit isn‚Äôt as perfect as some brands but is really good
-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balanced

Final call-
If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds‚Äî these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you

‚ÄîUPDATE‚Äî

Yes, but with a slight lower quality difference. Worth it? Yes","I compared these beats with AirPod pros. Both are Apple products.
The beats have a smaller range of volume, the lowest volume is pretty loud for the ‚Äúlowest volume‚Äù. Each level for volume going up is minimal compared to the AirPods. (At around 1/3 of the volume they match volume. AirPods get a lot quieter and ALOT louder, I‚Äôd say 10% louder) The beats are loud enough for me I leave it at 3/4 of volume.
Noise cancellation is really good, some noise filters through in loud environments but it‚Äôs enough when you‚Äôre at the gym and busy places. I experienced noise filtering through when I was in a car with music blasting. So I‚Äôd rate the noise cancellation pretty high.
Pass through, pass through is good. I‚Äôd recommend not having the pass through when there‚Äôs lots of noise cause it‚Äôs good and personally it can get loud. When there‚Äôs a sudden loud noise the earbuds make the same loud noise and it could hurt your ears if you have sensitive hearing.
Cons, when in loud environments if you are on a call the earbuds filter out the noise, and when you speak it filters your voice a bit too which makes it hard for the other person on the other end to hear you. Also the bit about the loud noise with the pass through and sensitive ears is a con for me.
Battery life is really good, lasts me my work day and a bit more, I‚Äôm sure like all batteries that would go down after use but hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet I‚Äôve had it for 2 months now.
Bluetooth, the Bluetooth is pretty strong. You could probably still have a connection a few rooms away in a house before the connection begins to fail. Unlike AirPods when you remove the bud from an ear whatever is playing will not pause unless YOU pause it. This means it‚Äôs constantly connected, when you are within the Bluetooth radius of course. I‚Äôve lost a bud twice but this actually helped me find it, so that‚Äôs a plus. And with these beats you cannot connect another pair to your phone like you can with AirPods. So it‚Äôs only on pair of beats at a time.
I really like the earbuds and I think they are well worth the price, to me they are a barely lesser version of AirPod pros. I‚Äôm considering getting the studio pro‚Äôs over the AirPod max after this experience.

Update 4 months later- The battery life is still very strong, I have had some issues with them disconnecting and reconnecting to my phone and I believe it‚Äôs because when I got my Apple Watch, it must be Confusing the connection between my phone and the watch. Yes, it can be annoying but to me, it‚Äôs still worth it. All really need to do is reconnect with my phone. I don‚Äôt think AirPods Will have this problem. But I‚Äôm not sure. There was one day where the noise cancellation on my right earbud stopped working, but it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have enough battery so I had to charge it after that I had no issues.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VNWOAUNTIIIK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B096SV8SJG,2024-11-10,69.0,positive,['life'],0.9903,electronics

The Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) is impressive too. I‚Äôve tested it in some noisy places, and it really cuts down the background sound so I can actually focus on what I‚Äôm listening to. It might not be the same level as over-ear headphones, but for earbuds, it‚Äôs more than enough.

it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it‚Äôs like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it‚Äôs not straight up refusing to connect it‚Äôs disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.

the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.

the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.

the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that‚Äôs a plus.

overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn‚Äôt pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.

I would like to state upfront that I bought these on sale for $75. I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.
Let's start with some pros:
The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.

Now some cons:
This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!

In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.

These buds sounds just as good, though I don't feel the transparency mode is all that quality, as it changes the output sound/quality in my ear but doesn't make outside conversations or ambient hearing any easier. I still have to pause or take one out. My biggest gripe is with the case. I love the size and feel of the case itself, though it doesn't accommodate all sizes of the rubber earbud tips without impacting the ability to charge effectively. I have smaller ears and I wanted to use the tips from my powerbeats pro and the studio buds case doesn't charge properly when you change up the tips.

Not GREAT, but not bad.","Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it‚Äôs a solid product but there‚Äôs something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.

For me, these are a perfect example of that. They‚Äôre small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don‚Äôt know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.

The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that‚Äôs just it, they‚Äôre alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it‚Äôs understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.

I‚Äôm also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There‚Äôs something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that‚Äôs just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúpremium‚Äù feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker.

My only thing is the amount they stick out. I‚Äôm sorry, but they do look a little‚Ä¶funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the ‚Äúb‚Äù logo is upright. They don‚Äôt stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you‚Äôll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that‚Äôs beyond pretty much anyone‚Äôs control.

These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don‚Äôt do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn‚Äôt say these are the best I‚Äôve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating‚Ä¶the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).

For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B096SSCV5K,2021-06-27,1.0,positive,"['amazing', 'perfect']",0.9988,electronics

The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.

**Sound Quality:**
One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.

**Display and Design:**
The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.

**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**
As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.

**Privacy and Security:**
Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.

**Overall Performance:**
The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2P2Q1EGK1FCPC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B2SBHQK,2024-08-23,57.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.999,electronics

So, I have increased from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Still not 5 stars because there is a device problem somewhere.  In addition, I believe the Echo Dot (no screen) is a better device - it ""hears"" better and has better sound.  If you run into the Echo Show going into zombie mode (where it appears to be rebooting, powering off, and repeating a doom loop over and over), try the following:

- Put it into factory default mode by holding Mute and Volume Down for 30 seconds until you see three dots appear on the screen.  It should enter setup at this point and if it works after setting it up, good.

- If you get through the setup process and parts of it repeat over and over, cycle power for one minute and try again.  This second step was necessary for me but it works now.

Thanks, Amazon support!

P L E A S E - - - READ MY EXPERIENCE UPDATE AFTER USING IT FOR 2 WKS. The disappointment started hours after plugging it in 2 Saturdays ago (Today is Dec 25th, 2023)
**UPDATE DECEMBER 25TH, 2023**

MAJOR disappointment.
It needs every subscription under the sun to enjoy 99% of it fully. Even ""Find my Phone"" is a charge! My ""Google Bot"" does not charge me for that.

It glitches a lot. In the 2 weeks it's been plugged in I've had to hard boot it 3 times.

AMAZON music sub or forget using it to play music you want. They support so many platforms... Not YouTube Red.

I bought the blink system, no pun intended, the cameras echo through the ECHO. 4 camera on sale too and so disappointed.

All games want you to pay for a service to use it fully.

No tier service plans... Just 25 bucks for this, 4.99 for that, 19.99 for this.. Like make a tier system or something.

It does not work friendly through the app or the ECHO itself. There is no way to have it on adaptive lighting and even wake it up and have the screen brighten a bit. Literally, no option for it. Like come on who can see that dark screen.. If you prompt it I should give off light.

It's not as friendly in its demeanor as ""The Google Bot"". No personality. No swearing. I asked it about a serious local news situation that the country is aware of for Vegas since the 6th of Dec, it told me ""Not sure what you're asking for"" my ""Google Bot"" gave me a 15 min break down of the first min of the horrible situation at my alma mater to the latest news. Sad.

The technology using it to do video calls, garbage. My tech abilities are expert level so no it's no my internet. My call with my mom and my husband both skipping, freezing. On their end and mine. Oh and forget adding all of your contacts.. That's a charge too. Otherwise you get 10 contacts it saves on itself only.

I'm so sad. I really was excited for this newer technology since I've had my ""Google Bot"" for six years.. It does more and knows more than this Echo.

The charges are the absolute worst for me. Find my phone? Really? Give me a break.

The speaker, not good over 50 to 60% ((60% is the highest you can go without it being tingy. I adjusted the mids, nothing changes... Even the little ask me the animal of the day if you want to keep going it does.. And shows you more animal sounds. But if you want MORE you have to pay for the service... For animal sounds..... Come on.

The smooth transition of screen to screen in where it flips through news..... Sadly lagging and skipping.

--IN CLOSING - - It's nothing of what I expected in speed. It's 6 feet from my modem.... It's not my connection...for the skipping screens. Lagging stories on the news when you ask it what's the story? Video calls... Useless. IT'S NOT even WORTH the sale price I got it for. Not even close.

The abilities it has to run your whole house, garage doors, emergency help, smoke, CO, thermostat list us longer than I've ever seen. If I can't even have me tell me what my local university updates are without it faking to even kno about it, who thinks I would roll the dice and pay all these subs and get more electronics to make the long list of things actually work.

1 star for technology for 2023
0 stars for personality, voice choice
0 stars for everything having a subscription montky cost.
0 stars for ease of use
0 stars for quality - freezing, skipping, lagging video play.
0 for sound.
0 for ease of app use with it
0 for BLINK app to use with Alexa
3 for looks, esthetic wise
2 for functions like making the screen brighter on adaptive lighting when touching it or voice prompting it
0 for cost of subs, extra gear.
1 for all it can do but at the price of each monthly cost to have them. Too afraid to buy the extras and add a subscription to it too.
4 stars for pre set up before even having it sent to me. Through email. Impressed, and that was the last time I was.
0 for more free options for even things like voices of Alexa, diff prompt names for Alexa, are all words I'd use every day but Ziggy do I went with that and still certain words I say pick it up and listen.

Overall average score for me (above stars) 2 stars all around.

Sincerely - - - - -

Disappointed in Prime/Amazon/Amazon's Customer Service.

It's about the size of a standard alarm clock, which is too small for our kitchen.  Rather than returning it, though, I decided to keep it for the bedside table, which appears to be what it was made for.  I then ordered an Echo Show 8 for the kitchen, which is a much better size for there.

Anyway, having this on the nightstand is nice, because not only does it function as a clock, but I can ask it about the weather, the news, etc. in the morning.  The bluetooth speaker has very good sound for its size.  Overall, it's a great purchase.  Except...

It's got a couple of really annoying flaws that severely limit its usefulness.  Ugh.  Amazon, I really hope you're listening here.  At least the first of these should be fixable with a simple software update.  The second, I'm not as sure if it's a software problem or a hardware issue, but I hope that it will at least be updated by the next model.  While I'm probably not going to return this one, I can't see myself buying another one of these (or recommending it to other people) until these issues get fixed.

So, first problem... Using it as a bluetooth speaker.  I like to play music from Apple Music on my iPad, and I was hoping to use this for that.  Yes you *can* link your Apple Music account directly into the Echo Show, but that's got a couple of flaws ‚Äì first, you can't browse, you have to tell Alexa what to play, and second, if you've got your own music that you've uploaded to Apple Music because it's not in the main Apple Music library (or another app entirely), there is as far as I can tell no way to access it.  So, using the Echo Show as a bluetooth speaker it is.  Except...

Once you pair your iPad with Alexa, it will very loudly announce that it's connected.  ""Now connected to Matt's iPad"" it says very loudly.  If I had it connected previously and I start using my iPad after leaving it sit for a while (say, I was listening the night before and I pick up my iPad in the morning to glance at the news), even if I'm not playing audio, it will make the same announcement again (which, totally unexpected like that, gives me a good jump scare).  Disconnect the iPad and it makes a loud notification sound (for a while it was saying ""Disconnected from Matt's iPad"" but I seem to have managed to at least turn that off... I'm not even sure how).  It does the same if I connect and disconnect my phone.

I don't want this.  It's super annoying.  I've tried every way that I can find to turn these bluetooth announcements off, and I can't do it.  I've searched the internet and found lots of other people complaining of the same issue, but Amazon hasn't fixed it.  Some of those have suggested turning off notifications as the solution, but I've tried that (even going as far as power cycling my Echo Show to make it reboot), and I *still* get the bluetooth announcements.  They just won't go away.

So, first thing this needs before I'll give it a good rating... Amazon, please do away with these bluetooth announcements, or at least make it possible for me to disable them.  Honestly, I'd prefer not to have to completely disable notifications to do it (there's no fine grain control over notifications, it's either all on or all off, which is a problem itself), but if that's how it has to be whatever.  Just get rid of these unnecessary and annoying bluetooth announcements.

Then, there's what is actually a much bigger problem, but may require a hardware update to fix... The auto-dimming.

So, in theory, I like and want the auto-dimming feature.  I don't want this to be at full brightness all night while the room is dark.  In the dark it goes very dim, but that makes it readable in the dark without being annoying or a distraction from sleep.  That's good.

Based on how this performs, though, I have to assume that the light sensor that controls the auto-dimming is on the front and very directionally focused.  It doesn't pick up on ambient light at all.

So if I turn on the bedside lamp, which happens to be located behind the Echo Show 5 on my table?  It doesn't pick up on it, it still thinks the room is dark, and it keeps the display so dim that it's totally unreadable in the lamp light.  I use my bedside lamp a lot when I'm in the bedroom, so that is a HUGE problem.  Even if I have both the overhead light and the bedside lamp on and the screen is bright, the moment I turn the overhead light off (but leave the bedside lamp on), it goes so dark as to be unreadable.

But even when I'm using the overhead light...  If I even happen to stand or sit so that I'm positioned between the overhead light and the Echo Show unit, it dims the display.  Not nearly as dim as it goes in the dark room or with the bedside lamp, but still dim enough to make it significantly harder to read.

So basically, I can only read the screen easily with the room brightly lit or totally dark, with light directly pointed at the unit or no light at all.  Anywhere in between and it becomes unreadable.  Of course I could ""fix"" this problem by turning auto-dimming off entirely, but then it would be brightly lit all through the night.  Which I don't want either.  Right now the only setting for this is either on or off, no in-between, no adjusting the sensitivity, nothing.

So Amazon, I don't know if this means that you need more light sensors on the unit than you currently have (maybe one facing the back of the unit as well), or if it's just a software tweak to make it more (or less?  I don't even know) sensitive, but SOMETHING needs to be done about this.  A screen that I can't read isn't useful to me.

Oh, and finally, this is more minor but what is up with the white power cord on my black/""charcoal"" device?  I didn't buy a white Echo Show because I didn't want a white Echo Show.  The power cord should match the device.  Way to cheap-out, Amazon.

Fix these problems and I'll feel much better about the Echo Show 5 and happily recommend it to others as a bedside device.  With these issues, though, I'm sorry, but I can't recommend it.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KRD5RSNZHTXE,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09B2SBHQK,2023-07-16,488.0,positive,"['great', 'useful']",0.9953,electronics

They are generally okay. I won't review ""Alexa"" here, just the device itself.

Set up is kind of tedious. I still don't know what ""skills"" provide. Otherwise the device works fine.

Now the drawback (minus 1 star): It doesn't really support installing ""apps"" in the traditional sense. They are simply features. If the feature doesn't exist, you can't install it. For example, there is no YouTube functionality. Instead, when you ask Alexa to go to YouTube you'll get Amazon Silk opened to YouTube. Amazon Silk is just a web-browser and YouTube is tedious to use from a browser on such a small device.

Oh, and Amazon Silk itself is a hot piece of garbage.

On the positive side, I love that I can just add things to my shopping list as soon as I think of them. I love that I can control lights remotely so I can tell Alexa to turn lights on and off before I come home, or while I'm away.

I was looking for a way to upgrade my streaming setup and get 4K quality without spending too much, and this device has delivered in all the areas that matter most to me.

Pros:
Amazing Picture Quality:
The 4K HDR support on this Roku is impressive. Watching movies and shows in 4K has been a noticeable upgrade in picture quality. Colors are vibrant, and details are crisp. Even older content looks better, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed seeing my favorite shows in a new light with such clear, sharp visuals.

Simple Setup and Easy to Use:
Setting up the Roku Express 4K+ was so easy. I had it up and running in just a few minutes, thanks to the clear instructions on the screen. The interface is straightforward, and navigating through different apps and channels is super simple. Everything I need is right there, and I don‚Äôt have to spend time hunting for what I want.

Roku Voice Remote is a Game-Changer:
The Roku Voice Remote is one of my favorite features. I love how easy it is to search for shows or movies just by speaking into the remote. It works really well, and I don‚Äôt have to scroll through endless menus anymore. Plus, it controls both the Roku and my TV‚Äôs volume and power, so I only need one remote.

Great Free and Live TV Options:
I‚Äôve been really enjoying the free channels and live TV access. The Roku Channel offers a solid variety of free movies and shows, and there are a lot of live news, sports, and entertainment channels available, which means I don‚Äôt need an extra subscription to watch live content.

Tons of Streaming Options:
Having access to all the major streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video is perfect for me. I‚Äôm able to find whatever I‚Äôm in the mood for, and the device handles everything smoothly. The app interface is clean and easy to navigate, which makes switching between different streaming services hassle-free.

Cons:
Not for Gaming:
While this device is great for streaming, it‚Äôs not built for gaming. If I wanted to play any serious games, this wouldn‚Äôt be the right choice, but that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm using it for, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

Audio isn‚Äôt Top-Tier:
The sound quality is decent but not exceptional. The built-in audio is fine for everyday use, but it doesn‚Äôt blow me away, especially with the 4K visuals. I‚Äôm considering adding a soundbar to get better sound to match the picture quality, but for now, I‚Äôm still happy with how it performs overall.

No Ethernet Port:
The lack of an Ethernet port is a bit of a downside for me since I prefer wired connections for more stable streaming. I‚Äôm using Wi-Fi, which works just fine, but I do notice occasional fluctuations in speed. Not a deal-breaker for me, but it's something I‚Äôve noticed.

Final Thoughts:
The Roku Express 4K+ has been an excellent addition to my setup. The picture quality is fantastic, the voice remote is incredibly convenient, and the setup was quick and easy. The free and live TV options are a nice bonus, and I‚Äôve found myself exploring a lot of new content because of it.

After doing some research, we bought this Roku Express 4K+ streaming player and found it works quite well.  We have hooked it up to an old Samsung 22"" TV (model code LT22B350ND/ZA) which was made in 2013.  Received it within a few days of ordering it and it took about 20 minutes to get it working.
Ease of use: Follow the included instructions.  I plugged it into our power strip rather than the TV USB port since I heard that there were issues related to that (one report of fire, some issues with inadequate power, etc.).  Remote takes a little time getting used to - I haven't figured out what all the buttons do and I still haven't figured out how to slave the remote to adjust TV sound.  I can imagine that will make my life easier because I won't need to use the TV remote for anything else except for changing the input source and doing some TV fine tuning.  Volume adjust/mute buttons are on the side of the remote which was an issue for a few people, but I'm OK with it.  From past reviews, sounds like the remote is not very durable but that remains to be seen.
Speed: quite responsive - no complaints
Appearance: The wireless receiver is quite unobtrusive.  This Roku comes with a mounting strip so you can stick it where you want it.  I just parked it on the TV base without the strip.
Battery life and the rest:  remains to be seen but for a gadget that cost less than $40, we're satisfied.  So much so that we will get another for our living room TV - it's a few years younger but we expect the Netflix and Prime Video software for it to eventually outdate.

I actually have a ten year old Roku 3 stuffed somewhere deep in a closet or something and it would have worked just fine.  I already have 99.9% of what this does built into my high-end projection TV. The only reason I bought it is that the makers of my TV won‚Äôt pay the Netflix licensing fee so I can‚Äôt watch the very few things I want from that service on their projector. So the one and only thing this will ever be used for is that purpose. I know most people are here wanting to read reviews with specs and opinions about the picture quality and things like that but if I made just one person‚Äôs life better by letting them know for thirty bucks (twenty if HD is good enough for you) you can make your TV or projector think it is compatible with that streaming service.  And it does work.  And maybe I‚Äôll pick up some additional content too, it looks like Roku is going big into the content creation business.

PICTURE QUALITY

If you got this far, don‚Äôt have high expectations from any review of the picture quality, there is no answer. It is what it is, 4k is 4k, how it looks on your TV will depend mostly on your TV, and to some degree your internet provider, but in any case the Roku box isn‚Äôt going to have a very direct influence on what you see.

QUIRKS

Oddly, Roku still uses line-of-sight infrared for their remote control while most remotes I am used to these days are RF. That means the receiver has to be located where the remote can ‚Äúsee‚Äù it. With today‚Äôs ultra-thin TV‚Äôs that can be a challenge because the sensor is located on the side not the face of the receiver, so for it to be ‚Äúseen‚Äù would mean to try to stick the adhesive strip on an edge of a TV that can be less than a quarter of an inch, or even rounded.  As if that‚Äôs not bad enough in my case I am using it with a projection TV and my projector is located behind our seating area. The only thing I could do is to choose the best location I could which still means I have to turn around and point the remote backwards at the projection TV. This is 2024, why hasn‚Äôt Roku kept up with the real world?

Also in the same category is that the four direct access buttons can‚Äôt be re-programmed. I know over the years they have changes those buttons as different TV sources come and go in popularity but what if one of the services (I‚Äôm thinking Disney) is something we would never use? That wastes 25% of the available buttons. Yet something we watch every day (I‚Äôm thinking YouTube) is not possible to assign to that unused button. Again Roku, this is 2024, even ten years ago I could assign my own favorites to a A and a B button, why aren‚Äôt you thinking of such things?

DEALBREAKERS

While I used the word dealbreaker I‚Äôll temper that by saying I am keeping this product, not because I want to but because if I want to watch Netflix on my projector I have to. But if that were not the case it would go right back to them right now. It took me three hours to set it up and I am highly technical, I set most things in in minutes usually without reading instructions. If you have a desire to bring back technology for the 1980‚Äôs this is the device for you. The setup is maddening. Whether or not you want to use their power button and volume control with your TV, that‚Äôs not your choice, they force that decision on you and there is absolutely no way to get past that first setup screen after it hooks up with your wifi. They give you a list of TV brands. If yours isn‚Äôt on the list, sorry, there is no way of saying so or skipping that option. Your only option is something they call Advanced (it‚Äôs not) which makes the assumption that your TV‚Äôs remote is infrared (mine is RF). Roku never heard of RF so you are dead in the water at that point. There is a CEC option but that is way technical and I don‚Äôt have to discuss it here. So I went online and not surprisingly they don‚Äôt say a word about it. I went to the user forums and other people have the same frustration but there was a lot of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know or useless suggestions with no way to give feedback that they were useless.  I finally did come up with a way to confuse the device and move on but not after a good part of my afternoon was gone.

YES NO MAYBE

My answer is that the HD unit at ten bucks less is so much the same that most people will never be able to tell the difference on 95% of what they watch. But if you are a perfectionist and ten bucks more isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker than you might as well splurge.  What about all the other models?  My opinion is your return on investment is very little with them, you get some nice but not necessary features but the price premium is far too much. Overall I would say this model gives you the best bang for your buck but that doesn‚Äôt mean I can endorse poor engineering and product design.

This Paperwhite is crisp, lightweight, and very fast in turning the pages.....I couldn't really ask for more. I never had a glare problem with any of my previous Kindles so I can't speak to that. I would encourage people to use dark mode if they are subject to migraines/headaches....I used to be only able to read for about 20 minutes and then my migraine pain would start but when Amazon came out with dark mode years ago that problem went away completely....it also does away with the screen too yellow problem others talk about, even though you can control that with the warm light slider control.  People seem to just nit pick the new Kindles and I just don't share their complaints...I have never had a problem with location of the power button & another user complained that you can't clean the screen of this Paperwhite because it will just turn pages....ridiculous! On the toolbar menu at the top if you tap on the 'more' button there is an option to disable the touchscreen...tap on that and clean away, no problem! I will agree that this non-glare screen seems to show fingerprints more but I always wipe my phone screen off every morning so I just do my new Paperwhite at the same time. I read many hours a day, every day, and have had many kindles since the original in 2007 and in my opinion they just continue to get better.  I thought maybe I would miss the page turn buttons, but I do not, not at all! This new Paperwhite turns pages so easily and quickly that I don't miss the buttons....I hold my kindle on the side with one hand (and I have small arthritic hands)  and just move my thumb about a quarter inch and tap the side of the screen...it is so easy, quick and automatic that I don't even think about it.

Unfortunately Yes, a very resounding yes!","I've had my Kindle since 2013, I've probably read over 1,000 books on this little piece of equipment over the past 11 years as it's been the most convenient piece of electronics I've carried with me on my travels.  I originally bought my Kindle to replace a Sony e-reader I had because the glare on the Sony version made it impossible to use outside and in brightly lit rooms, upgrading to Amazon's Kindle was a huge game changer for me.

I've been resistant to upgrading my Kindle for the past 5 years because, why would I? My 2013 Kindle still works quite well, the battery life is very long, and sure, I need to reboot it every few weeks otherwise it's too slow to use, and yes, it has issues connecting to my wifi every other month.  These were minor inconveniences that didn't seem to be worth fixing for $150+.  Well, I received my new Kindle Paperwhite yesterday and my first thought was - wow, this is a lot lighter.  Then I turned it on and I was sold!  Lightening fast, responsive, warmer backlight, larger screen, and significantly improved contrast for sharper letters.

When I bought my first e-reader in 2011 (Sony), I had to turn it off during take off and landing. We've come a long way since then and we know that an e-reader and other small personal electronics don't impact airplane instruments and you can read away non-stop on flights.  If you're putting off upgrading an old Kindle, and you have the money to do so, don't wait, this Kindle is far superior to models made over a decade ago; and, if you haven't done so, connect your Kindle to your local library for essentially an unlimited supply of free reading material.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO6OVWBCXRE94,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-24,50.0,positive,['life'],0.9851,electronics

Long story short? I loved that device... Literally, to death... After dropping it on terrazzo floors in SEVERAL airports world-wide, not to mention the myriad spills at home on more forgiving carpet. In fact, I loved it so much that when the 11th gen Scribe went on fire-sale a few weeks ago, I bought the cheapest version to replace my original (recently non-functional) unit, simply swapping my old premium pen for the basic one. Clearly, I loved the device enough to buy it again... I adore the ability to mark up .pdf's, the note-taking capabilities and that even with this extra functionality, it's still a very limited device that allows me to focus on reading first.

What I don't love, and never have? The weight. It's heavy to the point that I never used it if I couldn't prop it on something. Which led to it being dropped. A lot. Which led to the original unit failing. Not that it wasn't pretty sturdy... I mean, it survived repeated collisions with very unforgiving surfaces. It even weathered some relatively large liquid spills on and near it despite not being water resistant.  Now? I just use the Scribe when I need to mark up .pdf's (like, when I'm gaming... I can keep my character sheets on the Kindle), or need something that can display larger printed materials... Like RPG basic books or comics.  Hence, the new Kindle Paperwhite gen 12...

My new device isn't appreciably different than my Scribe except in a couple very important ways. The reviews don't lie... The screen contrast is higher, and in good light without backlighting, looks whiter. The device is much smaller, and seems a touch slimmer. It's also, very importantly, less than half as heavy, which means it's comfortable to hold in one hand while reading without tiring. I don't need to set it down on things, or prop it up, which reduces the threat of drops. When I'm out in public, I do have a cover for the device, and because it's so light, you can hold it open like a paperback, and it won't overbalance and fall out of your hand. The screen, given that it's half the size of the Scribe, seems to refresh much faster. It also seems to load the store faster, and settings menu navigation is measurably faster, as well. This is not surprising. The device is newer, and has less functionality. The one thing that I have detracted a star for is the battery life. I don't use the pen on the Scribe unless I'm actually writing, as it drains battery quickly. When you're turning pages with the touch-screen, however, you get exceptional battery life out of the Scribe. Not so terribly much on the Paperwhite. Granted, I'm not the average reader. 30 minutes a day is amateurish. When I use the backlight all day, I'm running down the battery at least 10% on the Paperwhite, if not more. Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but gone are the days of not bringing a charging cord for a two week vacation as I did with the Scribe.

I hear a lot of people make noise about the format... AKA, the Paperwhite doesn't have the extended lip on the side like the Oasis to make it easier to hold, and that it doesn't have buttons. Well, I understand that personal preference is personal preference, but... Who the heck wants another point of mechanical failure on a device that goes through a lot of punishment in public? I don't want my precious page-turn button breaking. Ever. And, let's face it... That's why everything is touch-screen these days. Yes, you might have to clean the screen more often, or bother to wash your hands before using your precious device (which you really SHOULD be doing, anyway), but these aren't exactly deal-breakers. Another thing that's come up even in professional reviews is people ""accidentally"" activating the bottom button. The question I have is, HOW?!? You need to alter your grip for leverage to depress it, the device is so light. The only other thing I've mused on is that the Paperwhite is just a plain plastic thing. It doesn't have the flashy aluminum back-side of the Oasis or even the Scribe... It doesn't look as luxe in the hand. And honestly? After the durability and weight issues I've mentioned above, I just plain don't care. If I'm in public, my device is in a case, anyway. I'm not an Apple person. While I experience SOME e-vanity, I don't think of my Kindle as a fashion accessory. Rather the opposite, as some people judge one harshly for going with an Amazon device in the first place. I'm here to read, and you probably are too if you're bothering to read this review.

All in all, it took less than a week for the Paperwhite to become my favored reading device for its' portability, its' weight and its' utility. I love the tiny thing! I look forward to years of care-free, comfortable reading without worrying so much about dropping my favorite note-taking device and general scratch-pad, the Scribe.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N2C0JP3FPQSM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-15,40.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.9701,electronics

I mostly watch TV, read newspapers, and read lots of online news websites.  I have not been a fan of reading books, but with this Kindle that is starting to change.  This makes reading easy and enjoyable.

I can only comment on my 2024 Kindle Paperwhite, but I don't see most of the issues cited in some 1-star reviews as showstoppers.  I find the ads on the cover screen are a minor inconvenience and certainly not worth spending $20 to eliminate.  The adds don't draw any power draining the battery, and they disappear as soon as you open a book to read.  Comments about a yellow tint surprise me, especially one review that included a picture that showed a definite yellow tint.  The reviewer had the warmth setting partially on, and of course, the screen had a yellow tint.  Set warmth to zero and brightness to 80% or more, and the screen background is what most people would consider paperwhite. I might turn on warmth and reduce screen brightness when reading in bed, in a dark room next to my sleeping wife, but I am very happy with the screen white color and readability.

I purchased the optional 9W charger, and it took my battery from 50 to 99% in about an hour and a half.  It is a nice charger block.  It annoys me companies no longer supply free power cubes, but even Apple stopped supplying power cubes with their iPhones.  So, it is what it is.  I didn't wait for 100% because Li batteries are stressed and take a long time to get through the last bit of charging to get to absolute 100% charge.

The Amazon branded cloth cover is very nice, maybe a bit overpriced, but you get what you pay for.  The cover color perfectly matches the color of my kindle, it is thin and lightweight, fits snuggly, and it folds back out of the way when reading.  Compared to the old cover on my 2nd gen Kindle, this this one is much less bulky.  The texture of the cover makes it less likely I will drop it on the floor.  I'm glad I went with the Amazon cover.  Make sure you are ordering the correct cover.  If you buy a 2024, 12th edition Kindle, make sure you buy the cover for the 2024 Kindle, and not the 11th edition.

A word about the trade-in offer.  I found it a bit confusing.  It said 20% off with trade-in, but when I chose the trade-in, it only appraised the value of my very old 2nd gen Kindle at $5. I assumed the 20% was a max trade-in, but they gave me 20% off plus $5.  With the black-Friday pricing, it was  a great deal.

There was an offer on the webpage of three months free Kindle Unlimited, but after I worked through the trade-in and chose the three piece bundle (Kindle, cover, and charger). the offer disappeared.  When I received and turned on my Kindle for the first time, the same offer came on the screen.  So, no harm done.  Overall, I really like the new 2024 Paperwhite.

Final Thoughts:
The Kindle Paperwhite 12th Gen is a solid upgrade from previous versions. It combines all the elements of a great e-reader‚Äîlong battery life, a glare-free display, waterproofing, and storage options‚Äîwith additional performance boosts that make reading even more enjoyable.

So lets review THIS model.

The sliding response time is slightly slower than a phones and dragging your finger fully across the screen only gives you 1 single page turn. Not ten, you won't be missing chunks of the book you are reading because you moved your finger a bit. In fact it seems to only turn the page after you slide roughly an inch either left to right.

However single taps are only slightly less sensitive than the average phone, so if you repeatedly tap left or right you'll flip through pages quickly. Make of that what you will.

The feel of the screen is lovely, in the image I tried to capture the texture of the screen using a bright light, it didn't reflect the light much so it does have that glare-free thing going for it.

The screen brightness and contrast is nice, I can't speak to what it once was but it is more slightly yellow than my phone at max white, and that helps with eye-strain, but perhaps not aesthetic for some. While I've yet to need bifocals that day is coming soon so I personally prefer the ability to read longer without discomfort.

As for longevity and battery life, again this bad boy was released on Oct 16, 2024 and today is the 20th. I can say I charged it, connect to wi-fi- and downloaded a bunch of audio-books and various books and then read 15% of a book with the brightness at half and I'm at 95% battery life, which doesn't seem bad for the amount of downloading this did.

Weighs about as much as my phone with a case on it, is easy to read at angles, is easy to navigate and quick to wake up. Wish I'd timed how fast it charged but I plugged it in a made some bread and it was charged fully from 57% when I was done.

Overall I am loving my purchase and glad I waited for the new one.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DVYBFNKO52NU,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPTK5JG,2024-10-20,91.0,positive,['life'],0.9701,electronics

However, I'm a bit frustrated with the set-up on this one. Some of this is operator error -- I've been trying to download too many books at a time, which keeps freezing up the system. So that's on me (and why this version currently gets 4 stars instead of 3). But when I first registered my device (which went smoothly) and then opened up my library, I discovered all but a handful of my books (of which I have well over 2000) were showing up as unread or partially read even though I currently only have 2 unread books. At first I hoped that the system would catch up (this was prior to me downloading books onto the new Kindle) as my content library on Amazon showed the books correctly marked as ""read"", but that didn't seem to happen so I manually went through and marked them all as read. To be fair, I found a few errors in my organizing in doing this so was able to fix a few things. Still, it was a frustration and time consuming. I should note that I did check for and ran the update when I first started the Kindle, too.

After two restarts to unfreeze the Kindle (again, probably my fault from trying to download too many books at once) plus a third one when the screen suddenly prompted me to register my device again (after having already done it and having 775 books already downloaded), I am going much more slowly on downloading so hopefully the rest of the process will finally go more smoothly.

One other quirk was a couple books that had been placed in collections suddenly showed up in the uncollected folder. Not sure if I somehow accidentally removed them from their collections (don't see how, though) or what was going on.

Oh one other quirk I nearly forgot was that my library was showing that I had 42 library books even though all had been long returned. So I also had to re-return them as part of the process of getting this Kindle ready to use.

I'm guessing this next concern is because it was trying to download books last night, but it was fully charged at around midnight and when I checked it about 8am this morning, it was down to 7% battery charge.

I'm hopeful all will be fine when all is said and done, but what I thought was going to be an hour long process is well into the double digits of hours with work left to be done. Ah well, I'm sure once it's all done and I can focus on reading, this frustration will simply be an unpleasant memory.

Update: All is forgiven with the above noted issues as it is easier to use, the screen is nice sized so easier to read...just wonderful!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FXAH02LZG3RX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7b42b720-3214-4ee3-9a82-de5f19eb39dd._CR0,0,442,442_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-28,4.0,positive,[],0.9623,electronics

In early 2019 I got the Paperwhite 10th generation, which was really nice (300 dpi made a BIG difference, although I pined for the large screen of the DX).

When Amazon sent me a blurb to meet the new kindle family, I decided to get the 12th generation kindle paperwhite in teal (it is more of a turquoise/aqua, NOT a jade green, just saying) regular (non-signature) edition.

My other paperwhite still works so I decided to keep it and not trade it in.  This paperwhite isn't much more yellow, which is great (I don't like the yellow hue).  If I turn off the warmth, it looks VERY similar to the 10th generation.  I don't read at a beach or bathtub or pool so I'm not going to test the waterproof feature.

The kindle is very thin, and I felt sometimes on the 6"" screen that I was speedreading without meaning to (I only read fiction, and I have the font at 6 bookerly).  This 7"" screen is really nice.  It feels more natural and I can immerse myself better.

Also, imagine to my delight that when I set the kindle up I offered me three months of free kindle unlimited.  The selection on that plan has really expanded and I have a big wishlist (smiley).

I declined the audible 30 day free trial, but it offered that, too.

Now I'm just waiting for the snap back/magnetic front cases to have some pattern that I like.

I usually don't upgrade things until they break (still using a 4 1/2 year old iphone SE 2020 and 2019 ipad) but I'm really happy that I decided to just treat myself to this kindle.

My other kindle (the 2019 paperwhite) is nicknamed awesome kindle in my account; this one I nicknamed beautiful kindle.

I hope everyone else loves their kindle as much as me (and yes, I still read physical books, too).  I remember learning how to read; it opened a whole new world to me.  I don't read to the point of being anti-social (LOL), but I definitely enjoy it on the bus, on my lunch hour, and relaxing at home, and in much downtime (single, no kids, basic 40 hour a week job).

Thank you for reading.  I know many people are commenting on the kindle and I just felt inclined to join in.  I liked the keyboard, but physical buttons aren't a dealbreaker for me, and I also don't have trouble with the button on the bottom.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MS0NTCNLBPSH,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPHV9ZN,2024-10-25,22.0,positive,['great'],0.9982,electronics

I live on the first floor of an apartment building. We are not allowed to install outdoor cameras or anything else on the outside of the building. My only other option was to buy indoor cameras that face out the windows. The cameras are adjustable. I bought multiple cameras because I live in a corner apartment. The Ring camera comes with the ability to manipulate what area your camera responds to. That is controlled from the app on my phone. This will stop my camera from being alerted if my cat comes near one of my cameras. Remember that all of my cameras are actually indoors and facing out through the windows. It also gives me the option of deciding whether it will record any motion or just motion that occurs when there is a person in view of the camera. And that function works as when I checked a motion sensor event, there was always a human being walking by or even in a different apartment building yard. I don't normally try to include any apartment spaces around me but that's kind of impossible because everything is so close here in the city. But the fact is that works perfectly, records perfectly and only records when there is human motion activity. So the camera can tell the difference between a human and a garbage can falling over from the wind. That's pretty cool. Setting up multiple cameras is very easy because it simply remembers the information on the app. I would recommend getting this camera over one of the blink cameras. I have a couple of them operating but they are nowhere near as sophisticated as the ring cameras. That's just a fact. Of course these are also a little bit more expensive, but they are worth it. It cost about $10 per month to put unlimited cameras from one household on a cloud recording system which is a good safety backup feature in case someone would rob the apartment and also take the cameras. The quality of the picture and videos are superior and very clear even at a distance. When the motion detectors are activated a very bright blue light which is easily visible through windows and screens becomes apparent to anyone outside, even in bright daylight. It is so bright that I think it would scare anyone away pretty quickly. Remember that the blue light is only activated when a person comes in view of the camera. This would scare somebody away I believe. So the blue light is not always on which is good. It also works perfectly with Alexa and I do have it hooked up to my Alexa system. You can simply ask one of your Alexa video devices like the Echo Shows to show one of the cameras which can be named to anything that you want it to be named to simply by changing the name of each camera in the app. You can also show it on a larger screen that is hooked into any Alexa system. The controls for this camera are simply amazing. There are so many different things you can do with these cameras. I live by myself so when I am out of town, I face one of the cameras inwards so I can watch my apartment and cat. Otherwise, I never point my cameras inwards but face all of them out the windows. It even has a setting for doing just that even though they are indoor cameras. What I am trying to say is that the cameras have a setting for looking out a window from indoors so as not to be disturbed by reflections. Also very cool and sophisticated as well is easy to manipulate. So obviously Ring is prepared for people facing these cameras outside through indoor windows. They clearly thought of everything. I would highly recommend buying one or more of these over the cheaper blink cameras. I highly recommend these indoor cameras that run on USB power.

With 1080p HD video, color night vision, and the latest in 2023 tech upgrades, this compact cam packs a serious punch. From installation to everyday use, it‚Äôs been a top-notch choice for reliable indoor surveillance!

Easy Setup in Minutes
Right out of the box, this camera was incredibly easy to set up. With step-by-step instructions through the Ring app, I had it up and running in under 10 minutes. The camera is small and sleek, so it‚Äôs easy to place on a shelf, countertop, or even mount on the wall. Plus, it blends seamlessly into any room without being intrusive, which I really appreciate.

Clear, High-Quality Video & Color Night Vision
The 1080p HD video quality is outstanding, delivering crystal-clear images both day and night. What really stands out, though, is the color night vision. Even in low-light conditions, the Ring Indoor Cam provides vibrant, detailed images that let me see everything in full color, adding an extra layer of detail that‚Äôs incredibly useful for identifying any activity. I‚Äôve even been able to zoom in and spot small details without losing clarity.

Instant Alerts & Two-Way Audio
The real-time alerts are fast and accurate. Any time the camera detects motion, I get an instant notification, allowing me to check in right away. This is perfect for monitoring the house while I‚Äôm at work or out for errands. The two-way audio is a great feature as well; it‚Äôs clear and allows me to communicate easily with anyone in the room, whether it‚Äôs checking in on the kids, saying hi to the pets, or even startling an intruder if necessary. It‚Äôs very responsive, and the audio quality is impressive for such a compact device.

Flexible Privacy & Customizable Features
Ring has done a great job making privacy a priority with this camera. I can set up privacy zones to block out specific areas in the room from view, ensuring that I only monitor the spaces I need. There are also customizable motion zones, which is helpful in cutting down on unnecessary alerts, like if I want to avoid detecting movement in a specific part of the room. This feature has made it super adaptable to my home‚Äôs unique layout.

Works Seamlessly with the Ring Ecosystem
If you already have Ring devices, this camera integrates seamlessly. I was able to link it with my Ring doorbell and outdoor cameras, managing everything from one app. The live view feature is also incredibly smooth and makes it easy to check in anytime from my phone, giving me peace of mind wherever I am.

Subscription for Added Security Benefits
While the Ring Indoor Cam offers plenty of functionality out of the box, I opted for the Ring Protect subscription, which has been a valuable add-on. With it, I can store and review video history, which has already come in handy a few times. The subscription is affordable, and it gives me that extra sense of security by allowing me to look back at footage if needed.

In summary, the Ring Indoor Cam (2nd Gen) is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their indoor security setup.

The Echo Pop is more compact and affordable than other Echos. It fits easily in my dorm and is easy to pack when moving between home and school.

Favorite features:
It reads my Google Calendar events to me, and I set personalized wake-up, evening, and unwind routines so that I have the external motivation to do what I need to do at the right times. I also like that I can set multiple timers/reminders without having to go on my phone, so it feels like I have a personal assistant.
I think the audio quality is pretty good as well, and I can pull-up my Spotify playlists (although if you give your playlists some complicated long name, it can be a bit harder). I usually just like to get Alexa to pull up the specific song or artist I feel like listening to at the moment and loop it though.

Improvement:
Because of school I use both Apple & Google products , and it's a bit frustrating not to be able to directly sync Alexa better with the Apple ecosystem. While it reads Google Calendar events, I'd like if Alexa could also see, create, and remind me of my Google Tasks, or do this with Apple Reminders. Currently, you'd have to check the Alexa app for notes that you create with Alexa, and there are no helpful widgets or syncing tools that work well for making this information more accessible.

Also I think the routines feature could be more flexible. Currently, if you want routines to activate at different times on weekdays versus weekends, you have to manually copy and create new routines, but I don't want the extra clutter.

Some other considerations:
Note that the Echo Pop needs to be plugged in at all times to function, so it requires setup every time you move it to a different room. I recommend getting a battery base if you want the flexibility to move it around, such as taking it to a common room or for listening to music while showering.

Overall, it has still added a lot of structure to my days, so I'd recommend it!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYBK0F6WD4SQA,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09ZXJDSL5,2024-07-30,109.0,positive,[],0.9872,electronics

At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.

Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said ‚ÄúAlexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.‚Äù It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn‚Äôt necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn‚Äôt going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.

That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can‚Äôt function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn‚Äôt have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.

Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren‚Äôt exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.

I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.

One other issue is with the alarm level. I can‚Äôt seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it‚Äôs time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.

Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as ‚ÄúPeaceful Current Radio,‚Äù or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.

Update:
I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can‚Äôt match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I‚Äôm considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.

Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can‚Äôt find that in my Apple music library.

I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:
Peaceful current Radio
New Standard WNYC
IPR Studio 1
KTUX FM
KSRY FM
WJIB FM
Caf√© Del Mar Radio
Americana Boogey Radio
Aloha Joe
Quiet Village Radio
WSBZ FM
Smooth Jazz 101
WABE Classical

That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!

It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!

Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I also needed an Echo Show, so I could check my security camera feeds. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.

I've also since purchased a third Echo Pop, this one in Midnight Teal to put in my bathroom.  Sounds like a strange spot, but hear me out.  I'm an older woman who lives alone, and I subscribe to the Alexa ""Call for Help"" service, and since a slip and fall in the bathroom isn't an impossible situation, I thought it would be smart to make sure a speaker is nearby when I'm in there as well.  Plus, the Midnight Teal is an almost exact match for the color scheme in that room, so clearly this is meant to be.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAZDNZHIEAFX1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09WNK39JN,2024-07-19,3.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect', 'love', 'life']",0.9973,electronics

He greets Alexa every time he gets home and says goodnight to her and gets a bedtime story from her while he waits for me to come read to him and tuck him in. We have successfully added a few Alexa skills (including Big Fart which MAY have been a mistake on my part) and so far they seem to work pretty well.

Pros:
- Cute dragon theme and image (Alexa introduces herself and says she likes to pretend she is a dragon and has a kid-friendly voice character)
- Optional additional Dragon Egg Cradle (have not personally purchased yet but am tempted)
- Great resource to allow kids access to audiobooks and learning materials with parental controls through the parent dashboard
- 1 year free subscription to Amazon Kids+ which is a great deal if you have an amazon kids tablet already (same price as you already pay for a year and an echo dot? Yes please!)
- An avenue for little ones to ask some of their random questions to someone other than overloaded parents
- Many cool Alexa skills from independent companies (Math practice games? Yes! Talk to Pikachu? Yes!)
- Alarm clock, speaker, nightlight and more in one!

Cons:
- Alexa can sometimes get very confused. This can be frustrating for anyone, but especially for little ones with little tolerance for the pitfalls of technology. Sometimes she doesn't hear you correctly and says she can't do something they know she can do. Sometimes she starts playing music while doing another skill and the speaker just can't take it. Sometimes she just plain doesn't listen the first 10 times you try and ask. It's........ frustrating and stressful when this happens to say the least. Teach your little one how to reset Alexa if this happens so they can feel in control instead of having a meltdown or running out screaming over her.
- Not all of the Alexa skills work quite how they are meant to and will totally mess Alexa up and require a reset and removal of the skill entirely.
- Alexa has very specific commands and these can be hard to remember sometimes. Consider writing out or typing up a list of the most common commands for little ones to help them remember the right order of words.
- The Echo dot can get surprisingly loud and when you ask Alexa to turn down the volume it is in very small increments so you will need to do it manually if they have somehow turned it up to blasting.
- After Alexa's bedtime has hit she will not respond to any commands or be able to use any skills. This includes asking her to stop playing something she already was, using a nightlight skill, or setting an alarm. The only option you have after her off time is to manually reset it so she goes quiet. The timer options are awesome tools to keep little ones from turning her on and playing with her instead of going to bed, but does restrict some of the bedtime options you could have like the nightlight.

The Echo Pop is more compact and affordable than other Echos. It fits easily in my dorm and is easy to pack when moving between home and school.

Favorite features:
It reads my Google Calendar events to me, and I set personalized wake-up, evening, and unwind routines so that I have the external motivation to do what I need to do at the right times. I also like that I can set multiple timers/reminders without having to go on my phone, so it feels like I have a personal assistant.
I think the audio quality is pretty good as well, and I can pull-up my Spotify playlists (although if you give your playlists some complicated long name, it can be a bit harder). I usually just like to get Alexa to pull up the specific song or artist I feel like listening to at the moment and loop it though.

Improvement:
Because of school I use both Apple & Google products , and it's a bit frustrating not to be able to directly sync Alexa better with the Apple ecosystem. While it reads Google Calendar events, I'd like if Alexa could also see, create, and remind me of my Google Tasks, or do this with Apple Reminders. Currently, you'd have to check the Alexa app for notes that you create with Alexa, and there are no helpful widgets or syncing tools that work well for making this information more accessible.

Also I think the routines feature could be more flexible. Currently, if you want routines to activate at different times on weekdays versus weekends, you have to manually copy and create new routines, but I don't want the extra clutter.

Some other considerations:
Note that the Echo Pop needs to be plugged in at all times to function, so it requires setup every time you move it to a different room. I recommend getting a battery base if you want the flexibility to move it around, such as taking it to a common room or for listening to music while showering.

Overall, it has still added a lot of structure to my days, so I'd recommend it!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYBK0F6WD4SQA,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09ZXJDSL5,2024-07-30,109.0,positive,[],0.9872,electronics

At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.

Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said ‚ÄúAlexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.‚Äù It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn‚Äôt necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn‚Äôt going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.

That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can‚Äôt function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn‚Äôt have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.

Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren‚Äôt exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.

I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.

One other issue is with the alarm level. I can‚Äôt seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it‚Äôs time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.

Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as ‚ÄúPeaceful Current Radio,‚Äù or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.

Update:
I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can‚Äôt match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I‚Äôm considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.

Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can‚Äôt find that in my Apple music library.

I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:
Peaceful current Radio
New Standard WNYC
IPR Studio 1
KTUX FM
KSRY FM
WJIB FM
Caf√© Del Mar Radio
Americana Boogey Radio
Aloha Joe
Quiet Village Radio
WSBZ FM

That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!

It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!

Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I also needed an Echo Show, so I could check my security camera feeds. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.

I've also since purchased a third Echo Pop, this one in Midnight Teal to put in my bathroom.  Sounds like a strange spot, but hear me out.  I'm an older woman who lives alone, and I subscribe to the Alexa ""Call for Help"" service, and since a slip and fall in the bathroom isn't an impossible situation, I thought it would be smart to make sure a speaker is nearby when I'm in there as well.  Plus, the Midnight Teal is an almost exact match for the color scheme in that room, so clearly this is meant to be.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAZDNZHIEAFX1,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09WNK39JN,2024-07-19,3.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect', 'love', 'life']",0.9973,electronics

Worth the price (on sale).,"I am a fairly heavy user of headphones and most recently have used AirPod Pro 2's.  I got the beats solo 4 on sale.

The sound is very good. The battery life is amazing. The blue color is nice. It is nice that it supports lossless audio via USB-C and also comes with both the USB-C cord and a 3.5 mm male to male cord.  They are also very light, and they charge very quickly.

They work great with Apple phones and other devices, including spatial audio. They pair easily. There isn't very much to complain about.

The only negatives that I have found so far is that it's not quite as convenient to switch between devices because it does not contain the Apple H1/H2 chip, and the clamping force of the headphones is a little too tight if you wear glasses. Hopefully that will loosen up on my particular headphones.

The lack of ANC is not a big deal. The earcups are very comfortable and they block out as much noise as a cheaper pair of ANC headphones. But, if you were looking for the sort of silence that you would receive from a more expensive pair of headphones, you probably should buy a more expensive pair of headphones.

The carrying case is nice and the headphones do fold to a fairly small size. They also seem fairly durable. The only discomfort that I have wearing them is from the clamping force; I don't know whether I have a larger small head, but I am about 6 feet tall and male. Maybe a smaller framed person would not have that difficulty.. I can wear them for a couple of hours and then it's time to give my head a rest.  I'd say for the price that I paid that is worth the trouble.

It's a common joke that beats headphones are typically found around people's necks.  I don't know whether that is true, but I can tell you that they are very comfortable around your neck. The smaller ear cups and general lightweight nature of this set of earphones make them a perfect candidate for wearing around your neck.

Finally, as a recent (and still) Apple snob, it is a little disappointing that the headphones don't know whether they are on your head or sitting on a chair, so they do not pause when you take them off.  Of course, they do not have any sort of passthrough sound capability.

If, like me, you are slightly disgusted that Apple failed to make any meaningful update to the Apple branded headphones that still cost an arm and a leg this year, these are a nice compromise, considering the price.

I saved the best for last and if you continued reading to this point, congratulations, because one of the things it is difficult to ascertain with an online purchase is microphone quality (for calls or voice recognition).  It is excellent, and the headphones sound at least as good as my AirPods Pro 2's for calls in both loud and quiet environments.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21IFUPN0YORZ9,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-11-08,171.0,positive,"['perfect', 'amazing', 'great', 'life', 'durable']",0.9915,electronics

So I returned it and swore off Beats products. Then I saw my sister was using the Beats Solo4s and tried them, expecting the StuidoPro experience. The sound quality greatly surpassed them and they fit snugly on my head. Impressed, I went on Amazon, found them at 50% off and picked them up. $200 is a bit overpriced imo for the features these include, but for $100 they're definitely worth it.

They are great for working out, a bit tight on your head, great fashion accessory, and sound fantastic for what they are especially without having noise canceling features.

The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.

These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.

Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.

Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.

The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.

Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2GA8R9KQR841V,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/dc15a77a-6df7-42ca-862a-b356d5c4b842._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CZPHPJLN,2024-10-17,105.0,positive,"['great', 'life']",0.9958,electronics

While they don‚Äôt include active noise cancellation, which would have been a nice addition, the extended battery life more than compensates for it. I‚Äôve been impressed by how long they last on a single charge, making them reliable for long workdays or travel.

The good?  It's an iPad!  New centered camera on the ""selfie"" cam is good for FT, no more weird angles.

Read this first!

Look for the asterisks in the text below.  Read that area first before clicking on the buy button!

My iPad 9th generation has served me well for the past few years but the battery life was beginning to suffer and the screen had a few scratches from daily use.

I could have had the battery replaced, but that seemed to average around $100 and that was a no-go, especially since I was offered just $90 on trade in so spending more just didn‚Äôt make sense.

Now Apple wants $349 for the base 64GB unit but I‚Äôve noticed that many stores have reduced the price to $299, possibly because Apple has discontinued sales of the 9th generation and supplies are starting to dry up.

So, I jumped at the chance to get a newer version.  I‚Äôve been a good boy this year and saved my money so I could afford this.

I got mine in yellow since the better half has hers in pink.  No confusing these two.

One thing you‚Äôll notice upon opening the box is that the overall dimensions are not much different from the earlier generation.

However, looks can be deceiving.  The screen goes from 10.2 inches to 10.9 mainly by decreasing the top bezel and by deleting the button and fat bezel at the bottom.

And that begs the question, how do I close out apps without pressing that button?

The android way, that‚Äôs how. You slowly swipe up from the bottom of the screen to expose open apps and then close them (or choose the one you want to use).

Those of you using iPhones know this procedure well.

Yet another question I‚Äôve been asked - where‚Äôs the fingerprint ID if the button is gone?

It‚Äôs now combined with the power button in the upper right hand corner.

I‚Äôd love to tell you that setup was a snap but I‚Äôd be lying.

******This iPad bricked while trying to do an update and transfer from my old iPad.  Thought I had a dud.

Called Apple and they discovered this one  was lacking updates from 2022 and needed to update from 16 to 17 and then to 18 before progressing.  Since my old iPad was already on 18.1, it was trying to force apps and settings to a new iPad that couldn‚Äôt readily take it.

Mind you, Apple verified this was indeed a brand new iPad and not a refurb or customer return.  It had just been sitting around in a warehouse for nearly 2 years.

So, in short, you‚Äôll have to do updates first, and then transfer from your old iPad.

And how do you do that?

* Sign in to your Apple account.

* Instead of allowing transfer from your iCloud or other iPad, tell it you want to do things manually.

* At that point it‚Äôll do the updates as required.

* Then you reset the iPad and start over; however, once the updates are installed they stay forever.  Now transferring from either the cloud or your open iPad should be a breeze.  A two hour breeze.

Plan on plugging it in, too.  You'll suck at least 30% of your battery doing just this procedure.*****

Now back to the review.

Overall operations are not drastically different from what I could see; however, I don‚Äôt use my iPad for heavy duty artistic work nor do I play intense games.  For Joe or Jane Everyday, this iPad won‚Äôt present any significant performance changes.

How about the screen?  Looks about the same to me.

Battery life?  Improved over my old tablet only because that battery was on its way out, but only time will tell if it is substantially better.

I will give points to Apple, though, for finally going to a USB-C charger instead of the Lightning variety.  I was getting tired of lugging different chargers around.

Now comes the last question - is this iPad worth the extra cost when you can still (possibly) find iPad 9s for $100 less?

Yes and no.  Yes, if you can get this model for $299 at which point it‚Äôs just $50 more than the 9th generation, comes with a bigger screen, and uses the readily accepted USB-C charger.

No, if you have to pay full retail of $350 or so.  At that point you might want to live with the Lightning charger and button at the bottom.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JV2VX0OS4WX0,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BJLCL22Y,2024-10-30,35.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.951,electronics

I found that support the Apple way is what I have looked for in technical support.  When you setup an iPad make sure you document every field you enter - Label also.  If you enter an email name for the Account and you forget that email name you are close to saying goodby to the iPad, I did forget what email name I entered, and Apple Support was GREAT in helping me to process the unit like it came from the factory.

Remember Amazon satisfy Apple that the unit you had purchased has been reset to factory default, if you entered an email name and forget what it is then you cannot clear that out and Apple thinks you are using the unit and if you want to return the Apple unit you can't, this means you have lost your money.  Kinda simple...

Well, I could not remember the email name I used, did I write it down or setup a record in my password list.  I looked in all my trash cans for maybe a note, could not find anything.  I use a data wallet, and it has worked but you have to keep the data - I went through my last copies of the backups for the wallet and when I got back to the DATE, I received the iPad I saw an item for iPad - I made sure I had a good paper copy, loaded the current version of wallet data and started setup of iPad again.

Sound it a little better, more 3D like, but this is no comparison to a soundbar (but it CAN be linked to a soundbar or bluetooth speaker). The alexa voice is a BIG differnce, more lifelike.

I've had the display on my new Show 8 (gen. 3) stop working twice in the 3 weeks I've owned and used it. Since this is not my first Echo Show (I've owned 5 of them over the last 4 years, including the 3 I still have now), and I know this display problem is not normal. A reboot (unplugging then replugging in the electrical power) restored the display the first time. This second occurrence of the problem left me concerned: how often can I expect this issue to resurface, and does it just indicate a hardware defect in my unit? So I made the accompanying video so that you could see what I'm referring to.

It turns out that telling Alexa to ""Turn Off display"" while it's having this malfunction (while the display is black and the Display is non-responsive but while the device still responds audibly) And then saying ""Alexa"" (the wake word) restored the display and its responsiveness (to touch and verbal commands).

But I don't think that's a permanent fix.

Amazon customer support did advise toggling off the Auto Sleep setting in the device. This might be an acknowledgement of a software bug in that feature, but if it is, it's not afflicting my other Show (a current generation Show 10) that's using Auto Sleep.

Except for the above, I do like my third generation Show 8 for the quality of its sound, responsiveness, overall utility (alarms, podcast-listening, news briefs, clock, timers, display of weather conditions, calendar events, home automation of smart lights and smart plugs for fans/+, hours and phone numbers of local retailers, etc.), and the display - when it's functioning properly!

My Show 8 (gen. 3) did have one other problem during my first 3 weeks of using it: Increasingly, I needed to repeat the wake word (""Alexa"") to get the Show 8's attention. So I positioned my other Show 8 (gen. 1) near it on the same table and asked them both the same question - first the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8, then the ""gen 1"" Show 8 (which uses ""Echo"" as it's wake word). Then I listened to the Voice Activity in the Alexa app on my phone. There was considerable Distortion in the new ""gen. 3"" Show 8's recording, while the recording of the old (gen. 1) was remarkably clear. The short story is that Amazon customer support recommended the obligatory reboot, and that ""fixed"" it - for now, at least. (There was a theory that there may have been an external cause, but my testing has been unable to find evidence of that.)",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5YCHTGOSUF1J,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3Y632,2024-08-01,114.0,positive,[],0.9744,electronics

I've had several devices for years, just for the fun of it, but now I truly appreciate it as a life-saving device for the elderly. It is better than wearing a life-alert pendent--which studies show that the elderly will not wear, even when they have them. My sister has early stage dementia. We are committed to helping her live independently in her own home for as long as possible.  She is always misplacing her mobile phone, and then she goes into a panic.  Alexa to the rescue.  Now, if she falls, she can merely say, ""Alexa, call for help."" or ""Alexa, call [first name] [last name].""

I got her 2 Echo Show devices: one for her bedroom and one for her living room.  Now, she can phone me through Alexa. She doesn't need to remember numbers or even operate her mobile.  I have written up commands for her to remind her that she must always say Alexa's name first.  Alexa will help her live independently and safely for longer.  The daily reminders that you can set are also important. I have set several reminders for her to take her night-time medicines.  And Alexa speaks the reminder aloud as well as shows the message on the screen.

Also, with Alexa Echo Show 5, 8, 10 etc. you can drop in on a loved one and see what's going on in their home.  It's like a nanny-cam. This is an invasion of privacy, but it essential in checking on an ill or disabled loved one, and you limit those who can drop in on you to just a few trusted caretakers and point the camera in a way to preserve personal dignity.  It gives the hearer a warning that someone is ""dropping in"" and they can block the intrusion, should they want.  I think you can drop in on the audio versions also (you just can't see anyone), but those would be appropriate in a bedroom or bath.

I'm still learning all the good things that Alexa will do.  It has a major learning curve, but once you set it up, it works beautifully--so long as your internet stays on.

Of course, adding Alexa means that big brother is watching you and listening in to your conversations.  If you watch a TV show with a character named Alexa (e.g. My Life is Murder on Acorn TV), then your device can be very annoying.  But you just say, ""Alexa, stop.""

These are small trade-offs for those of us who live alone and are getting up there in years.

It is a versatile smart display that offers excellent balance between size, functionality, and price. With its 8-inch HD screen, decent audio quality, and Alexa capabilities, it makes an ideal choice for both entertainment and smart home control. Here‚Äôs a closer look at the pros and cons of the Echo Show 8, particularly focusing on its smart home integration features.

### Pros

1. **Crisp Display**: The 8-inch HD screen is a great size for viewing content, checking recipes, and video calling. The screen is clear and responsive, making it easy to navigate.

2. **Decent Audio Quality**: It has better speakers than smaller Echo devices. Its sound quality is suitable for listening to music, podcasts, and watching videos with reasonable bass and clarity.

3. **Alexa Capabilities**: With Alexa, the Echo Show 8 can manage reminders, answer questions, play music, and control smart home devices. Alexa responds quickly to voice commands and is always improving.

4. **Smart Home Integration**: It integrates well with a wide range of smart home devices. It can control lights, thermostats, security cameras, and more. The screen makes it easy to view live feeds from compatible cameras, such as Ring doorbells, giving you real-time control over your home‚Äôs security.

5. **Video Calling**: The 13 MP camera allows for clear video calling, with features such as auto-framing that keeps you centered in the shot as you move. It works with Alexa-to-Alexa calling and supports Skype and Zoom.

6. **Privacy Controls**: Amazon includes privacy features, including a physical shutter to cover the camera and options to manage microphone and camera permissions, which is reassuring for privacy-conscious users.

### Cons

1. **Screen Resolution**: While the display is HD, it‚Äôs not as sharp as some high-end tablets or competing smart displays. Some users may find it adequate for the price, but others may wish for a higher resolution.

2. **Limited App Compatibility**: The Echo Show 8 supports streaming from platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix, but it lacks native support for some other popular services, like Disney+.

3. **Occasional Lag**: Some users have reported occasional lag with certain features or apps. While it performs well for most tasks, the Echo Show 8 can feel slightly sluggish with more intensive usage.

4. **Heavy Amazon Ecosystem**: It is very much tied into the Amazon ecosystem, so users who aren‚Äôt invested in Alexa or Amazon services may find some limitations in their experience.

### Smart Home Integration

The Echo Show 8 really shines when it comes to smart home integration. Through Alexa, the device can connect to a broad array of smart home gadgets, including lights, plugs, cameras, and locks from popular brands like Philips Hue, Ring, TP-Link, and more. The screen enables unique capabilities, such as monitoring video feeds or managing device groups (e.g., turning off all lights in one room with a single command). Additionally, Alexa routines allow you to automate complex tasks across multiple devices, making it easy to personalize your home automation.

### Verdict

The Amazon Echo Show 8 is a strong choice for anyone looking to add a smart display to their home. It‚Äôs reasonably priced, offers solid performance, and integrates well with most smart home systems. While it‚Äôs not without its drawbacks, particularly regarding screen resolution and app limitations, the device remains a valuable addition to a connected home. Whether you‚Äôre new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, the Echo Show 8 offers a great balance of features and value.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJW9GGJXX70AX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3Y632,2024-10-29,3.0,positive,"['great', 'versatile']",0.9989,electronics

The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.

**Sound Quality:**
One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.

**Display and Design:**
The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.

**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**
As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.

**Privacy and Security:**
Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.

**Overall Performance:**
The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2J1CVS95RNQ3J,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLS3Y632,2024-10-07,0 people found this helpful,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.999,electronics

The device setup has a lot of nice features like content casting from your phone and automating your TV power and source functions, and custom themes.

If you want a wired connection, you can buy a USB Ethernet Adapter for Roku Express. Make sure it has the right style mini USB male input to match your Roku's mini USB female input (A or C).

The only thing that puzzled me is that it does not turn off. Where the power button normally is on the Remote, you have a ""back arrow"" that takes you back to the last menu in most of the apps and the Roku menus.
According to the instructions, you can unplug it to turn it off.
Or, you can plug the Roku USB cable into your TV's USB, then it will turn on/off with the TV.

You can buy a USB splitter if you are already using the USB (for media in my case).
I don't want the Roku drawing power, however little it uses, when I'm not watching it.

Once you power on the TV, select the source button HDMI you set the Roku to, and your streaming services are a button push away. There are even 4 buttons on the remote for Netflix, Max, Paramount and AppleTV.

The Roku OS and the Apps work smoothly.
I have managed to upset one of the Apps. It froze while I was endlessly perusing titles. All of the buttons were inactive, but I kept pushing the Return Arrow on the upper left and it finally closed the app and went home. On another streaming device, I had to unplug it. There are YouTube guides for a stuck Roku.

There is a reset button on the rear, BUT I Only Use It When You Want to Clear Settings. Unplug It First.
The instructions state:
""Certain Roku models come with a physical reset button on the back or bottom of the device. This button is either a tactile button or a pinhole button. You can reset these devices to factory settings by pressing and holding this button until you see a flashing light"".

There are of course FREE shows and movies. And there are links to Premium Streaming Services have many Free Trials and Free Episodes you can access. So, you get instant gratification with just your Roku Express and an internet connection.

The device setup Seems to Require a Credit Card during your online (PC Browser) account population. But, it is not needed (scroll to the bottom) if you already have your Credit Card Payment info setup with your Bank to pay your streaming fees.

Of course you can put your card in to buy screen savers and other stuff if you want. But, if it is there, it is easy for anyone watching your TV to spend your loot.

The Roku comes with a 3 Foot HDMI cable. One of my two Roku Express had 2 USB cables,. It had a Mini USB and a Mini USB C. The other device just had the correct USB cable that fit it's device.

There is a sticky strip to attach the small Roku to your TV.  I put mine close the TV remote sensor (left side of my TV) so I am in the habit of pointing my remote at the right spot.

Prior this purchase, I was using my BluRay player to stream 2 of my services and I used my HTPC Chrome browser to access the other 2 services.

Gen 1 gen 2 and gen whatever and they have all ended up the same way....in the garbage can. I have a small TV by my bed that I like to fall asleep watching - it's my nightly ritual, but my Firestick obviously did NOT get the memo because it has proceeded to block or delay me from watching something just about every night over the last 4 or 5 months. I have rebooted it time and time again. Unplugged it and even reset it to the factory settings once because it was, for some inexplicable reason, running out of memory. Even after deleting about every application I had installed, many of which, BTW, the device will NOT let you delete...which is another issue I have with the Firestick. Anyway, the reset worked for a while and I thought all was good but I was wrong. Slowly but surely is started to pause and I waited only to see the message that ""something went wrong""....no kidding. Click okay to restart...which also takes forever. The lockups the pausing, the error codes, the nightly reboots and unplugging.....my gosh what a piece of junk. This is no exaggeration....I have sat down to go to bed and spent upwards of 30 minutes or more, messing with the Firestick to start a video so I could lay down and fall asleep. Seriously.....EVERY SINGLE NIGHT I had to deal with this piece of junk !!!

I even swapped it out the other day with one in my home office that had not been used in a while, geez I wonder why, and it did not even start up. Just died while sitting doing nothing other than being plugged in. I was done, done, done.

Why I did not try a Roku device long ago I will never know, but it is working flawlessly and only took me about 15 minutes to configure. That is less time than it took my Firestick to boot up every night. No it does not control the volume or turn off my TV, but neither did my Firestick, but what it does and does well, is it allows me to start Netflix or HBO in seconds. No delays, no losing the network connection, no spinning circles that usually result in errors.....just point and click and booya !!

It is not perfect to be sure. I am not a huge fan of the select and arrow button setup. Would be nice if the buttons were spaced further apart and the select button was more pronounced so you can operate it more easily by feel...which I do a lot, but I suspect I will get used to it over time. It also allowed me to easily customize my screen and delete ANY preinstalled apps from view, no exceptions, and the process was very intuitive. I have not read the instructions and don't think I need to at this point.

Outside of the need to have a Roku account and the initial push to purchase various packages and streaming platforms and enter a payment option, which I did not do, the Roku has gone silent. It just does it's job every night like a good remote should and for a third of the prices of a Firestick and I could not be happier.

If you are wondering if a Roku will work better than a Firestick....the answer is YES !!!

I have one of the half dozen Firesticks I have purchased over the years still in my garage/gym and so far it seems to be okay. I know it's just a matter of time until it bites the bullet though...it's not a matter of IF. I might be wise to just get a another Roku now and save myself the frustration of another ""system update"" which is another story all together....but I will spare the details !!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R382CVP2VHKIHE,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/f4f8a467-b433-404a-a3e2-c19c60820b9e._CR0,0,374,374_SX48_.jpg",True,B0BCH5H2R3,2024-08-09,75.0,negative,[],-0.5166,electronics

I have and still use both the ROKU branded and AmazonFire products.  YOu mgiht be wandering which you should purchase if you are just getting into streaming...

THE ANSWER:  THese boxes (Roku or Amazon Fire) have a slightly different interface and different look, but they both will get you to where you want to go...

Personally I would start with a Roku and when you have a need for a bit more...go to an AmazonFire device...  I think the ROKUs are a bit easier to learn,  And the Amazons give you more to expand one.  For the prices of the BOX, you cant go wrong purchasing either.  SO dont fret over which you have purchased and whether you made the right decision.  THere is NO wrong decision....  This was a great buy, and I have furnished rentals, so I needed a backup.  I own LOTS of each and different grades (more storage, speed, network connectivity etc (hence a difference in price levels for different boxes.)...

FWIW, I have an 82 year old neighbor...who, with his wife decided to make the CHANGE away from Network TV to streaming about 5 years ago.  He was paying about $150 a month for standard cable.  Of course you will need an internet connection (which you probably already have) a TV (digital) and a ""BOX,""  Bob (neighbor) tells me (yesterday) he gets EVERYTHING he needs and only splurges to get Netflix.  The amount of FREE CONTENT is phenomenal (fee - nominal)...personally I also suggest an Amazon Prime account for varioous reasons....

These  boxes and streaming are NOW, not the future....  ANd the $$ to make the change is minimal...BoB now saves about $135 per month vs his old cable TV subscriptions, and he LOVES the content.  I started him out with a ROKU box.  [Due to a power outage this summer, he spent a couple days in one of my furnished rentals that had an Amazon FIRETV.  He had NO trouble switching (Boxes)..but still prefers the ROKU boxes at his home.  And he has no interest in dealing with ALEXA...

Why pay almost $200 for a service when you can get television for free?

To get started, there is a learning curve. You're not going to just turn on the TV and watch local channels in real time. It is streaming. So essentially it's like watching television through your computer, and you are going to have a little bit of an adjustment time depending on your skill level with computers and internet streaming. This is not to discourage any seniors or anyone who's not computer savvy, you just may have a longer learning curve.

However, you can still get some local channels, and you can still get a lot of news channels, you just have to know how to find them and to get optimal access.

A lot of your Roku exoerience depends on how much television you watch. If you watch a lot of television and you still want to keep cable or satellite, I would recommend getting basic service and then supplementing with Roku. If you just want something for when the power is out, you can just buy this one time stick and not get any supplemental services they sell or subscriptions.

If you don't watch a lot of television, this is a perfect choice. Especially if you're off-grid for any reason, this is an option to not ever have to worry about getting connectivity due to location or thunderstorms.

I was on satellite at my last location and when there was a technology issue, I happily switched over to Roku and after just a few days I did not miss regular television cable or satellite at all. I had it for several months, now and back on satellite. But will be back strictly to Roku soon and it's just so fabulous, I know I will not miss satellite.

I don't bother with the subscription because I don't like subscriptions, but you can also upgrade to get more options if you'd like.

For such an inexpensive upfront cost, you get so much out of your Roku stick. I believe you do have to have Wi-Fi, So if you don't have Wi-Fi at your location, you should be able to get Wi-Fi from your phone, but you'd have to check with Roku for that.

(A subjective review, duh)","I never take the time to write reviews because why spend so much time on something that will ultimately have no effect on my life? Well in this case, these Airpods have met and exceeded every single one of my expectations and I figured that was worth writing about.

Important disclaimers:
- OF COURSE this is a subjective opinion, because that is all a review is. Take it with a grain of salt.
- Different products work better or worse for different people, it's just that simple.
- When talking about noise cancelling headphones, it's important to consider them for what they are, not what we think they SHOULD be.

THE FIT:
OKAY. I am someone who has very small ear cannals. I have spent years trying to find earbuds that fit my ears comfortably. Silicone in-ear tips have always been extremely uncomfortable for me. That being said, I did own the first gen Airpods Pro for a couple of years before buying these Airpods 4. I wanted earbuds that I could exercise with, use for commuting, and use for blocking out sound when I'm at school or on an airplane. The airpods pro fit the bill, but I could only wear them for short periods of time before they would start to seriously hurt. On top of that, they would always slowly come out of my ears. It didn't matter what size of eartips I used. My ears are just NOT made for in-ear silicone tips. BUT THESE AIRPODS 4!!! Holy smokes they are so comfortable. They never fall out. I can wear them for hours at a time and not even notice them. I haven't worn a pair of Airpods this comfortable since the gen 2 Airpods. The 3's didn't work for me either, but somehow apple really cooked up the ideal fit for these Airpods 4.

THE NOISE CANCELLATION:
Okay. Obviously, these are NOT going to have the same level of noise reduction as in-ear earbuds because there is no seal created by any silicone tips. If Airpods Pros and silicone tips have always worked for you, just buy those. However, considering that the noise cancellation in these Airpods is ALL driven by software, I have been extremely impressed with the results. It reduces the white noise of annoying sounds like public trains, airplanes, etc. very effectively. While voices and other louder sounds aren't cancelled completely, when music is playing through the earbuds these noises are quite enough to hardly notice. For me, that's enough. I don't need complete silence, I have my over-ear noise cancelling headphones for that.

THE SOUND QUALITY:
When I say that I was blown away the first time I listened to music on these Airpods, I was NOT kidding. The amount of bass that they managed to pack in to such small, open-eared earbuds is frankly impressive. The sound profile allows for an incredible listening experience no matter what genre of music you listen to (I listen to a wide range of pop, folk, indie, and rap primarily).

THE OVERALL VERDICT:
These Airpods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation are exactly as I expected them to be. They fit extremely well, the ANC is very acceptable for what they are, and they sound amazing. That's not to mention the TINY case that they come in, making them so easy to slip anywhere. I have been looking for a solid pair of earbuds with ANC that work with my ears for the longest time now. I'm happy to say that these are everything I've ever wanted. If you have had issues with silicone ear-tip earbuds fitting you properly, then these are definitely worth a shot!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZQULX0AUSOTW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0DGJ7HYG1,2024-10-21,126.0,positive,"['incredible', 'life', 'amazing']",0.9976,electronics

The sound quality is just listenable, I have listened to many professional headphones and Airpods 4 clearly can‚Äôt compete with them.

2. This model isn‚Äôt an upgrade to Pro - it‚Äôs an upgrade to Airpods 3, therefore I do not understand why it is compared to completely unrelated model.

Delivery
The box came undamaged and unopened. Verified that the product is original. Make sure to choose the model which is both sold and shipped by Amazon.

Airpods
As for my experience, the AirPods exceeded my expectations. The fit is excellent, I had no issues with the previous models but it seems to fit a bit better for me. They stay secure even during activities like running.
The most impressive thing - ANC. I was pleasantly surprised at its quality, especially given the lack of silicone tips to passively block external noise. I live on a very busy street and it completely blocked all the noise. Gesture controls are surprisingly useful as well.
Set up took 2 seconds - opened the case and connected immediately. I also like that the case is smaller, which makes it easier to carry around. While it doesn‚Äôt come with a charging cable, it supports USB-C and can be charged with an Apple Watch charger as well.

I figured it was time to upgrade and try out the new AirPods 4 due to some of the new features I wanted.

The biggest feature I wanted was a Find My speaker built in.  I had  lost the case ofr my current AirPods a few times and ended up attaching an AirTag to them inside an airtag case.  THis was bulky and made it awkward to keep them in my pocket.  Being able to play a sound without an extra accessory attached is huge.

I also like the wireless charging and USB-C compatibility.  I have wireless chargers near my bed and on my desk where I work so I can pop them on anytime.  The internal magent also makes them stay in place kind of like an Apple Watch.

The sound is really good.  An improvement over the previous ones but maybe a little more heavy on the low-end, so everything sounds a litle different with these.

I like the spatial audio ability and hopefully will find a reason to use it soon.  I have some audiobooks that offer it, but I don't really care if the narrators voice changes with my head motion.  Hopefully I'll find some concerts or something that make it feel like I am in a concert hall or something.

I am a little torn on the squeeze button on the stem.  I like being able to perform more actions than I could with a double tap of the old model, but if my hands are full or dirty, I can't just smack them with the back of my hand to activate the actions.  Being able to answer or decline calls or confirm Siri actions with a head shakle or nod is nice and maybe they will extend that to include customizeable head gestures so I can do things like play or pause music/books.

The ANC and transparency modes are cool.  I usually leave them in transparency mode and only use ANC if I am doing something like vacuuming.

The biggest issue I have with these is that they are not as comfortable as the AirPods 2.  Those I could put in my ear and quite literallyu forget they were there.

None have ever fit so well, they stay in my ears when all others would fall out, including my Gen2s(!), or sounded this incredible. The noise cancelling is superb. As a person with hearing issues and mental triggers with sound/noise overload in a crowded room, the Adaptive mode works wonders for conversing with someone right next to you while bringing the room noise to a very tolerable level. Then there‚Äôs the sound quality and clarity, in a word, Wow! I‚Äôve held on to my Gen2 AiPods, until now. Nothing I‚Äôve tried anywhere, is better than these with the Noise Cancellation. I‚Äôve had similar experience in Quality/Depth of sound but there was either too Much cancelling or not enough clarity and depth of sound range. This brings the best of both in one package. Not too much cancelling and at least giving options, along with a great sound-field presence, especially in full range audio of Dolby-Digital movie audio tracks, other hi-res sound sources, all while not Being hi-res certified (that I‚Äôm aware of)

When setting up the watch we were going back and forth with updates and problems because this watch requires firmware 18.xx and we have iPhone 13.

I recently purchased the **QINLIANF Wall Charger Surge Protector** with **5 outlets** and **4 USB charging ports**, and it‚Äôs been a total game-changer for organizing and powering my devices. Here‚Äôs my detailed review after using it for several weeks.

### **Design and Build**
The **3-sided design** of this power strip is perfect for maximizing space. The outlets are thoughtfully spaced out, so even larger plugs don‚Äôt block the neighboring outlets. This is a huge plus compared to standard power strips where larger adapters tend to crowd out other ports. It‚Äôs compact but functional, making it perfect for use in small spaces, whether at home, in the office, or when traveling.

The build quality feels solid and durable, and the **1680J surge protection** adds peace of mind, knowing that my electronics are safe from power surges. The sleek white design also blends nicely into any room without being too bulky or noticeable.

### **Charging Capacity**
With **5 AC outlets** and **4 USB ports** (3 regular USB-A and 1 USB-C), this power strip can charge multiple devices simultaneously without overloading. I‚Äôve been using it to charge my phone, laptop, tablet, and a few smaller electronics, and it handles everything effortlessly.

The **USB ports** offer a combined total of **4.8A**, and they deliver fast and efficient charging. I especially love the inclusion of the **USB-C port**, which is perfect for newer devices. It‚Äôs great to have everything charged in one place without needing multiple adapters or cluttering my desk with chargers.

### **Surge Protection**
One of the standout features is the **1680J surge protection**. This level of protection ensures that even during power surges or spikes, my devices are safe from damage. I‚Äôve experienced power fluctuations in my area, and knowing that my expensive electronics are protected gives me a lot of peace of mind.

### **Perfect for Travel**
Because of its **compact size** and **multiple outlets**, this power strip is ideal for travel. It‚Äôs small enough to fit in a carry-on bag or suitcase, and the **multi-plug adapter** design means I can charge several devices at once in a hotel room or other travel locations. The built-in surge protector is also a bonus when traveling to places with unreliable or unstable power sources.

### **Easy Installation**
The extender simply plugs into a standard wall outlet, and it stays securely in place. It has a **screw hole** at the top if you want to secure it more firmly to the outlet, which I did in one of my rooms for extra stability. There‚Äôs no complicated installation process‚Äîit‚Äôs truly plug-and-play.

### **Pros**
- **5 AC outlets**: Plenty of space to plug in multiple devices, with a smart 3-sided design for easy access.
- **4 USB ports**: Includes 3 USB-A and 1 USB-C, offering fast and efficient charging for multiple devices.
- **1680J surge protection**: Protects valuable electronics from power surges and spikes.
- **Compact and travel-friendly**: Perfect for home use, but also compact enough to bring along when traveling.
- **Sturdy and secure**: Fits snugly into the wall, with an optional screw to secure it more firmly.
- **Fast charging**: The 4.8A output provides fast charging, even when charging multiple devices at once.

### **Cons**
- **USB ports share output**: While the combined output is 4.8A, heavy users charging multiple high-power devices (like tablets and phones) simultaneously may notice slightly slower charging times on all devices.
- **No power cord**: It plugs directly into the wall, so if you need something with a cord for more flexible placement, this may not be ideal.

### **Final Thoughts**
The **QINLIANF Wall Charger Surge Protector** is a compact yet powerful solution for anyone looking to **organize and protect** their devices. Whether you're using it at home, in the office, or for travel, it offers a perfect combination of **multiple outlets**, **USB ports**, and **surge protection** in a space-saving design. If you‚Äôre tired of dealing with cluttered chargers and want peace of mind with surge protection, I highly recommend this product! It‚Äôs versatile, reliable, and efficient‚Äîeverything you could want in a power strip.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2B0D2VQ78JH3X,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B08R6S1M1K,2024-09-21,3.0,positive,"['perfect', 'great', 'versatile', 'love', 'durable']",0.9991,electronics

Update!,"I have had my Kindle for over a month, and I am still excited about this Kindle. However, I just saw that it is on sale (Black Friday Deal), and I wanted to cry. It is now $45 less than what I paid (excluding the cost of the charger and case; add another $60 to that $45 (Ouch!)).

Then, I had to have a talk with myself, and it went like this: Trinigal, stop being upset! You are fortunate to have purchased a Kindle that works well, and doesn‚Äôt have issues (like others who have shared the dissatisfaction with their Kindle).
You are still enjoying your reads and always looking forward to your next read. I then chuckled to myself, and said that the title of the next book I select should be: When is the right time to buy a Kindle?

My original review is below:

This is my first Kindle, so I don‚Äôt have any other Kindle to compare it to. I usually read a physical book, books on my Computer, IPad or iPhone. This Kindle makes a difference in my ability to relax while reading a book. It is an awesome device that is portable, light weight, and convenient.

Although I like reading on my IPad, it will no longer be my go to device for reading (When you know better, you do better).

My house is full of unread books that I bought over the years, and that really bothers me because I just couldn‚Äôt find the time to read (being a professor with lots of other academic books to read, I gave those academic books priority over a good novel). Now, I am at the point where I want to read books for relaxation purposes. I chose the Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition as part of my incentive to read a good book.

I researched this Kindle for an entire month before investing in it.

Let‚Äôs get to the workings of the Kindle:

This 7 inch Kindle is easy to hold in my hands. The IPad truly strained my hand when I tried to use only one hand when reading. At times, I had to lean the IPad on my thighs for support. Now, there will be no more hand to thighs when reading!

The Kindle set up was very easy, and user friendly. I did not experience any problems connecting to the internet.

After set up, with bated breath, I waited to see how the pages turned on the Kindle, and if I will find any fault with the action of turning the pages of the book I was reading. I am happy to say there was none; no noticeable long lag time, no problems were experienced with the turning of pages on this Kindle.

Then I squinted my eyes, opened my eyes wide, I turned the Kindle upside down, and side to side while turning to the next page of  my book; I was trying to see if there will be any trace of the previous page as I turn to the next page ( ghosting; some users experience an imprint of the former page while moving to the next page of their book). Happy to report, I tried hard to find a problem with that but I found none.

What about the battery?
The battery charged very quickly, and there was no problem during that process. I did charge the battery with the case on the Kindle, (as the picture shows). The Kindle came with an 80% charge and in 30 minutes (or less) it was fully charged (100%).

I am hardly ever swayed by reviews:
Sometimes reviews work as an incentive, or a deterrent‚Ä¶.I always say, try an item out and make your personal decision.
This Kindle is a keeper, and I am also going to purchase the new Color Kindle Colorsoft.

Conclusion:
This Kindle paper white Signature Edition , Gen 12/32 GB, is truly made for reading. It is certainly a handy device for traveling, and reading on the go. It is easy on the eyes, and therefore, easy on the brain. The raspberry color is really nice, and I plan on buying an extra clear case so that I could easily see the vibrant color of the kindle.

I am honestly excited to be part of the Kindle family!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2E96RK60QWPS0,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPP8C33,2024-11-05,135.0,positive,[],0.9957,electronics

It brings to mind another device that featured strikingly good sharpness and contrast despite the layers over the screen: The Voyage. I don't have one on hand to do a direct comparison, but it certainly seems to have that same sort of secret sauce going for it. I'll be very interested to see some direct comparisons from people who still have a Voyage on hand. It's not as apparent in photos, but I'm surprised at how much sharper it is than my 2021 PW. I knew from the early reviews that it would be better, but I wasn't expecting it to be so noticeable. Even my beloved Oasis comes up short in a direct comparison!

Much has been made of the speed of this iteration of the PW, and it's not just empty hype. I never thought the word ""fast"" would ever really apply to an e-ink screen due to the limitations of the technology, but the Kindle team has made that a reality. Pages turn as quickly as I can tap the screen, and while I've never cried out to the heavens about page turns being too slow, it's impressive to see such responsiveness on an e-ink screen. The true benefits of this speed come into play when navigating menus, adjusting settings, and especially when typing. I honestly did not think it was possible for an e-ink screen to be so fast and responsive. This is truly impressive. The speed in itself is not a reason to upgrade to this model, but if you're already considering an upgrade, it is definitely an extra enticement.

Despite the larger screen, it's very nearly the same size, measuring about a millimeter taller and wider. Annoyingly, it's just enough that the device won't fit in cases made for the 2021 model. (At least, neither of the ones I have.)

The back of the device feels very similar, just a bit slick. I still have no difficulty holding onto it. The power button is still on the bottom, and though I understand why some are annoyed by this, it's never been an issue for me. I've been using Kindles for thirteen years, and while about five of those saw me primarily using an Oasis, that's still a good eight years I used various basic and PW models. In all that time, I don't recall ever pressing the power button by mistake. So I get why it's a point of irritation for some, but it's not a mark against the device for me.

I have a Colorsoft on order, and this PW was intended as an early Xmas gift for my mom. While I set it up for her, I just couldn't resist playing around with it a bit, and it has really won me over. If I wind up not keeping my Colorsoft, I'll definitely be getting one of these for myself. The improvements are mostly small, but those little things add up to a noticeably superior experience. Despite the lack of page turn buttons, which I truly love, it just may supplant my Oasis as my main reader!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGICHT7FOSW8G,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/0776b7ff-a403-41ed-a182-e2b5e73672f1._CR0,0,436,436_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CFPP8C33,2024-10-20,219.0,positive,['love'],0.9983,electronics

QC is garbage! Return process the worst in the Industry,"Shopping for a new Kindle is like playing Russian roulette. You‚Äôre taking a huge gamble, taking on a big risk because the quality control is absolute garbage now at Amazon. Amazon is literally going backwards with the Kindle. This is my second Paperwhite and it‚Äôs even worse than the first. I figured why not take another chance on the premium Kindle Paperwhite signature edition thinking that it‚Äôll somehow be better, not the case. It‚Äôs even worse than the standard Paperwhite which was really bad to begin with. As a comparison, I have my Kindle Paperwhite 7th generation from 2015 that is leaps and bounds much better than this garbage new edition.

Now for a little background‚Ä¶

I have owned every Kindle starting from 2014 when I got the Voyage. Right off the bat the new Kindle Paperwhite has an overly yellow screen, meaning that the light is significantly yellow. It‚Äôs not white, it‚Äôs not even subtly opaque. But YELLOW! To make things worse, the screen lighting isn‚Äôt even even. It‚Äôs has a darker yellow band towards the bottom of the screen. This is not only my device, but across the board. This is confirmed across multiple websites, including YouTube and Amazon reviews on here. So the lighting issues not only affect the new Kindle Colorsoft, which is getting absolutely flamed for the same issue, but it also affects the new Paperwhite.

The other issue is that all new Kindles no longer support Apple computers due to the new MTP format that the Kindles are using. This means that you have to go through the hassle of downloading a third-party application to do simple things like update new software and side-load fonts.

Which leads me to my next issue, side-loaded fonts are no longer properly supported. You can still side-load fonts BUT every time you open a new book, it automatically defaults to the Bookerly font, even though you have saved a certain font setting. This is extremely annoying!

The next issue is that you can no longer download and transfer a book through the content settings on the Amazon website with new Kindles. If you want to download a book that you have purchased, Amazon has eliminated the ability for you to do that. WHY???
Amazon service has no answers regarding this.

Needless to say I returned this device for all of the stated reasons and guess what!?! Amazon is going to take 30 DAYS to refund me my money! I have to wait 30 DAYS to get my money back because Amazon has a defective and unsatisfactory faulty device. Not only that, but I have to make sure that somebody is home because the only return option is UPS pick up. You can no longer have the convenience of dropping it off at your local UPS store, Kohl‚Äôs or Staples. Only UPS pick up!!! Maddening! Next time if I ever purchase another Kindle, it will not be through Amazon. But yet, if new Kindles are this bad, why bother!

Now let‚Äôs talk about aesthetics and design. It seems Amazon is going backwards in their hardware. The voyage was released 10 years ago in 2014 and if you were to compare them side-by-side, one would think that the Voyage is the brand new model. Aside from the having micro USB, the Voyage has a sleeker, more premium look with page turn sensors and better materials with a micro etched glass screen instead of plastic. It also has a curved symmetrical design for better feel as opposed to a basic slab like the new Paperwhite.

Lastly, Amazon has done absolutely NOTHING to improve their software. You still have the same limitations that you did since day one. Kindles have the same limited margin settings, limited font size settings, and limited line-spacing settings.

I have a lot of side-loaded fonts that I would like to use but am unable to because they‚Äôre either too big or too small with the slightest increment in size adjustment. Absolutely ridiculous! Also, the boldness options are too thick, with slightest adjustment a font will go from too thin to too bold. A total joke!

I have had nearly every version of the 12 generations of kindle at one time or another.  Each has shined in their own right from kindle keyboard to oasis and now the 12 th generation paperwhite signiture edition.  The speed with no ghosting, lightweight, screen quality, increased size, improved design make this the most impressive kindle yet!  I wanted to say that about the colorsoft, but color means comics and comics on a 7‚Äù screen just don‚Äôt work.  So when the scribe goes color, count me in.  That said, this is like a portable paperback book that is comfortable to hold with one hand and the Enjoyment of reading is unparalleled.  I have tried Kobo and even own a boox note air 4c and while each of those are great at some things, this has the whole package.  For comics I use my boox note air 4c, but the dictionary on the kindle is the best!  Adding a dictionary to kobo and boox can be done, but not the oxford concise like on the kindle.  On Boox you have to get the app, copy the word go to the app and look it up.  That is better than kobo where I had to go to my phone or paperback dictionary.  Anyway a good dictionary is a must and kindle has the whole package.  I could take a star away for the closed echo system of amazon as I would like to be able to put them on my kobo or boox devices directly, but I also want authors to get paid and I actually am ok with drm.  Torrents raise the price for those that pay so I applaud amazon for doing what they can for the authors.

Admittedly, I don‚Äôt know much about the device, as I previously ordered ebooks from their competitors and I use a service for the blind available to me for audio books. I did some research before buying and learned of the accessibility features on the kindle, which is of utmost importance to me. I went with this version (paper-white SE) for the auto adjustable lighting and wireless charging (which I have not used yet, but plan to in the future).

As previously mentioned, I ‚Äúread‚Äù ebooks purchased from other sources and used my iPad which has a ‚Äúread to me‚Äù feature. The kindle offers a VoiceOver option, but it is not as great as the iPad feature. The number one annoyance I have with the Kindle is the non disability friendly Home Screen. WHY is enlargement and font size not accessible on the Home Screen? For someone with vision loss like myself, I can‚Äôt read anything on the main page. This is also the same struggle with the Settings page. Being able to enlarge the screen and change (or bold) the font would be helpful on the Settings screen too.  However, once I get to a book, the accessibility features such as enlarge print, spacing, etc, are acceptable and functional. I would hope products like the Kindle are evaluated and tested for wide consumer use. The blind and low vision community likes to read too, and we can, using technology which I hoped was already integrated on the device.

Moving on from accessibility, the device is lightweight, slim, and easy to carry. It even fit - with a case - in my Lululemon 2L belt bag without issue! I used it without a case for a few weeks and it was easy to hold, though did leave fingerprints on the backing (easily removed with a microfiber towel). Charging time varies, though the battery life is exceptional, having not charged for a week and not even down to half the battery. The screen moves flawlessly- most of the time, though there have been a few instances where the screen moves flawlessly ‚Äúglitched/jumped‚Äù and refreshed. It‚Äôs a split second annoyance, but otherwise it‚Äôs fine almost all of the time. Other than a case with ‚Äúwake‚Äù features, I wish I could touch screen to go from the book cover back to the book without having to push the button on the bottom of the device.

All in all, I am happy to be a new member of the Kindle family, but hope their next model is a little more advanced in accessibility features.  I would purchase again and I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to gift to a fellow reader.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G9W20XUIMRRW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/16b92844-9380-4cee-9cb3-819cb264c344._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CFPP8C33,2024-11-26,6.0,positive,"['great', 'life']",0.9936,electronics

I really like the experience of reading without a light shining in my eyes. When it is too dark to read, I like that I can change the brightness and color temperature of the light. I can take all of my books and audiobooks with me wherever I go. It‚Äôs light so it doesn‚Äôt bother my hands if I read for a long time. I like its size. However, it‚Äôs not perfect. I have some issues with the software and the hardware:

Software:

Clunky: The user interface feels very unpolished, clunky, cluttered, unintuitive, and not user friendly. It‚Äôs a mess. I wish there was a Home Screen with a Kindle app, an Audible app, a documents app, a browser app, a store, and a settings app. Instead, we have one cobbled together monstrosity trying to be all of those things at once. All of my audible books, documents, and kindle books are thrown together and you have to set filters to find things. You can set up collections but you can‚Äôt put audiobooks into collections so they clutter up the ‚Äúuncollected‚Äù folder. The OS just feels lazy, like they didn‚Äôt put much thought or care into the user experience. The swiping gestures also feel unintuitive.
Translation: I am learning a foreign language and most of what I read is in that language. When I come across a word I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs nice having the ability to translate that word right on the device. However, every time I need to translate a word, I have to select the word, then Wikipedia will show up then I have to scroll over to translate, then select the language menu, scroll through the list to find the language, select it, and finally I get the translation. I wish I could either get rid of Wikipedia or move it so the first thing that pops up is translation. I want to be able to download the language I am translating for use offline and delete the others from the list of available translation languages. The language detection feature rarely works. I just want to select the word and immediately see what it means.

Hardware:
Power button: Why in the world did they put the power button on the bottom of the device? This has become really bothersome. My pinky naturally rests right where the button is and the screen has turned off many times. It also means I can‚Äôt rest the device on my knee or other surface while reading.
Charging light: It‚Äôs on the bottom next to the USB-C charging port. The issue is that I read before bed so I charge it on my nightstand. The light illuminates the room which is annoying. I‚Äôd rather just have a charging symbol show up on the screen.
Material: The material feels like plastic. I read that the regular Kindle Paperwhite comes with a softer material, which I want. I paid more and feel like I got a downgrade in this area.

Also, I don‚Äôt understand why people are so upset about the lack of buttons. I love that this doesn‚Äôt have buttons.

Overall, there is so much potential in this device but Amazon is holding it back.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1JRRSHJ1326LC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0C8RR4WN3,2024-10-22,15.0,positive,"['perfect', 'love']",0.96,electronics

While I encountered some challenges with connectivity to my Onn TV, the overall performance and quality of these speakers have left me quite satisfied. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience.
Setup and Connectivity
The initial setup of the Bluetooth speakers was straightforward and user-friendly. Connecting them to my other TV was a breeze; I simply powered on the speakers, activated Bluetooth on the TV, and they paired instantly. However, I did face issues connecting them to my Onn TV. I suspect this is due to compatibility limitations with the TV itself rather than a fault with the speakers. For anyone considering these speakers, it‚Äôs worth checking your device‚Äôs compatibility to avoid similar issues.
Sound Quality
Once connected, the sound quality of these Bluetooth speakers truly impressed me. They deliver rich, clear audio that significantly enhances the viewing experience. The bass is robust without being overwhelming, providing a well-rounded sound profile that makes movies and music come alive. Whether I was watching action-packed films or listening to music, the audio clarity and depth exceeded my expectations for speakers in this price range.
Design and Build Quality
The design of the speakers is sleek and modern, fitting well into any home decor. They are compact enough to not take up too much space but still powerful enough to fill a room with sound. The build quality feels solid, which gives me confidence in their durability over time.
Price Point
One of the most appealing aspects of these Bluetooth speakers is their affordability. At under $10, they offer exceptional value for money compared to many other options on the market. There are certainly more expensive speakers available that boast additional features or brand prestige, but for someone looking for quality sound without breaking the bank, these speakers are an excellent choice.
Conclusion
In conclusion, while I did encounter some connectivity issues with one of my TVs, the overall performance of these Bluetooth speakers has been highly satisfactory. They provide excellent sound quality, are easy to set up, and come at an unbeatable price point. With so many Bluetooth speaker options available today, finding one that balances quality and affordability can be challenging, but these speakers do just that. I would recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their audio experience at home without spending a fortune.

This is definitely one of the better ones ESPECIALLY at this price point. If you're willing to drop whatever cash you need to to have the best sound possible, you can certainly get better. But for the cost of a sit-down restaurant meal for one person? Not likely.

Sound quality is GOOD but not GREAT. Sound carries really well. Sitting in my living room, I can hear it clearly even at low volume from the bedroom. In my office at work, I can hear it from down the hall. The specs say it can stay connected to its Bluetooth source for 33 feet, but I had it connected at nearly 50, and it was still working (although it started to get spotty before I realized my phone was in my pocket). When I used it at a tabletop game store, it drowned out everybody else's speakers even at low volume.

Battery life seems to be about 4 hours at low volume before it starts complaining. It charges fairly quickly.

It FEELS very cheap when you hold it, so I'm not sure how much of a beating it can take. Not that it's expensive enough that you have to buy it a carrying case (the case would likely cost more than the item), but you should probably be gentle with it.

I have not tested its supposed waterproof capabilities (and don't intend to, because why on earth would I?).

I've never really put energy into researching surge protectors until I was creating my own workspace and needed power outlets where there were none. I wanted to maintain the aesthetics of the space and get surge protected power where I needed it.
1. Someone thought about the design of this little guy for longer than whoever designed the atrocious looking 14"" x4"" black, clunky, surge strips we're all used to seeing in offices and workspaces. The design is both utilitarian and pleasing in the event it cannot be hidden from view. It's slim profile in the outlets, cord, and plug, allow for the unit to be mounted out of sight (and remain accessible and useful,) but when it cannot be easily mounted/hidden, it's not an big ugly power strip.
2. The spacing of the outlets was considered as out gadget plugs become more and more cumbersome - AND almost as a little utilitarian bonus, you have USB-A + C along one edge! This thing just keeps getting better!
3. The cords of yesteryear were big, bulky, immovable, snakes that were so cumbersome they became a workplace hazard and OSHA requires even bulkier plastic covers to be placed over the cords to prevent trip and fall injuries. This cord is just as strong, but easier to maneuver into small spaces and lays flat against the wall or floor. I just can't believe it took this long for someone to bring such a useful, thoughtfully designed necessity to our lives. Thank you YISHU!

I would encourage people to use dark mode if they are subject to migraines/headaches....I used to be only able to read for about 20 minutes and then my migraine pain would start but when Amazon came out with dark mode years ago that problem went away completely....it also does away with the screen too yellow problem others talk about, even though you can control that with the warm light slider control.  People seem to just nit pick the new Kindles and I just don't share their complaints...I have never had a problem with location of the power button & another user complained that you can't clean the screen of this Paperwhite because it will just turn pages....ridiculous! On the toolbar menu at the top if you tap on the 'more' button there is an option to disable the touchscreen...tap on that and clean away, no problem!

Unfortunately Yes, a very resounding yes!","I've had my Kindle since 2013, I've probably read over 1,000 books on this little piece of equipment over the past 11 years as it's been the most convenient piece of electronics I've carried with me on my travels.  I originally bought my Kindle to replace a Sony e-reader I had because the glare on the Sony version made it impossible to use outside and in brightly lit rooms, upgrading to Amazon's Kindle was a huge game changer for me.

I've been resistant to upgrading my Kindle for the past 5 years because, why would I? My 2013 Kindle still works quite well, the battery life is very long, and sure, I need to reboot it every few weeks otherwise it's too slow to use, and yes, it has issues connecting to my wifi every other month.  These were minor inconveniences that didn't seem to be worth fixing for $150+.  Well, I received my new Kindle Paperwhite yesterday and my first thought was - wow, this is a lot lighter.  Then I turned it on and I was sold!  Lightening fast, responsive, warmer backlight, larger screen, and significantly improved contrast for sharper letters.

When I bought my first e-reader in 2011 (Sony), I had to turn it off during take off and landing. We've come a long way since then and we know that an e-reader and other small personal electronics don't impact airplane instruments and you can read away non-stop on flights.  If you're putting off upgrading an old Kindle, and you have the money to do so, don't wait, this Kindle is far superior to models made over a decade ago; and, if you haven't done so, connect your Kindle to your local library for essentially an unlimited supply of free reading material.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RO6OVWBCXRE94,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-24,50.0,positive,['life'],0.9851,electronics

Long story short? I loved that device... Literally, to death... After dropping it on terrazzo floors in SEVERAL airports world-wide, not to mention the myriad spills at home on more forgiving carpet. In fact, I loved it so much that when the 11th gen Scribe went on fire-sale a few weeks ago, I bought the cheapest version to replace my original (recently non-functional) unit, simply swapping my old premium pen for the basic one. Clearly, I loved the device enough to buy it again... I adore the ability to mark up .pdf's, the note-taking capabilities and that even with this extra functionality, it's still a very limited device that allows me to focus on reading first.

What I don't love, and never have? The weight. It's heavy to the point that I never used it if I couldn't prop it on something. Which led to it being dropped. A lot. Which led to the original unit failing. Not that it wasn't pretty sturdy... I mean, it survived repeated collisions with very unforgiving surfaces. It even weathered some relatively large liquid spills on and near it despite not being water resistant.  Now? I just use the Scribe when I need to mark up .pdf's (like, when I'm gaming... I can keep my character sheets on the Kindle), or need something that can display larger printed materials... Like RPG basic books or comics.  Hence, the new Kindle Paperwhite gen 12...

My new device isn't appreciably different than my Scribe except in a couple very important ways. The reviews don't lie... The screen contrast is higher, and in good light without backlighting, looks whiter. The device is much smaller, and seems a touch slimmer. It's also, very importantly, less than half as heavy, which means it's comfortable to hold in one hand while reading without tiring. I don't need to set it down on things, or prop it up, which reduces the threat of drops. When I'm out in public, I do have a cover for the device, and because it's so light, you can hold it open like a paperback, and it won't overbalance and fall out of your hand. The screen, given that it's half the size of the Scribe, seems to refresh much faster. It also seems to load the store faster, and settings menu navigation is measurably faster, as well. This is not surprising. The device is newer, and has less functionality. The one thing that I have detracted a star for is the battery life. I don't use the pen on the Scribe unless I'm actually writing, as it drains battery quickly. When you're turning pages with the touch-screen, however, you get exceptional battery life out of the Scribe. Not so terribly much on the Paperwhite. Granted, I'm not the average reader. 30 minutes a day is amateurish. When I use the backlight all day, I'm running down the battery at least 10% on the Paperwhite, if not more. Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but gone are the days of not bringing a charging cord for a two week vacation as I did with the Scribe.

I hear a lot of people make noise about the format... AKA, the Paperwhite doesn't have the extended lip on the side like the Oasis to make it easier to hold, and that it doesn't have buttons. Well, I understand that personal preference is personal preference, but... Who the heck wants another point of mechanical failure on a device that goes through a lot of punishment in public? I don't want my precious page-turn button breaking. Ever. And, let's face it... That's why everything is touch-screen these days. Yes, you might have to clean the screen more often, or bother to wash your hands before using your precious device (which you really SHOULD be doing, anyway), but these aren't exactly deal-breakers. Another thing that's come up even in professional reviews is people ""accidentally"" activating the bottom button. The question I have is, HOW?!? You need to alter your grip for leverage to depress it, the device is so light. The only other thing I've mused on is that the Paperwhite is just a plain plastic thing. It doesn't have the flashy aluminum back-side of the Oasis or even the Scribe... It doesn't look as luxe in the hand. And honestly? After the durability and weight issues I've mentioned above, I just plain don't care. If I'm in public, my device is in a case, anyway. I'm not an Apple person. While I experience SOME e-vanity, I don't think of my Kindle as a fashion accessory. Rather the opposite, as some people judge one harshly for going with an Amazon device in the first place. I'm here to read, and you probably are too if you're bothering to read this review.

All in all, it took less than a week for the Paperwhite to become my favored reading device for its' portability, its' weight and its' utility. I love the tiny thing! I look forward to years of care-free, comfortable reading without worrying so much about dropping my favorite note-taking device and general scratch-pad, the Scribe.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N2C0JP3FPQSM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-15,40.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.9701,electronics

I mostly watch TV, read newspapers, and read lots of online news websites.  I have not been a fan of reading books, but with this Kindle that is starting to change.  This makes reading easy and enjoyable.

I can only comment on my 2024 Kindle Paperwhite, but I don't see most of the issues cited in some 1-star reviews as showstoppers.  I find the ads on the cover screen are a minor inconvenience and certainly not worth spending $20 to eliminate.  The adds don't draw any power draining the battery, and they disappear as soon as you open a book to read.  Comments about a yellow tint surprise me, especially one review that included a picture that showed a definite yellow tint.  The reviewer had the warmth setting partially on, and of course, the screen had a yellow tint.  Set warmth to zero and brightness to 80% or more, and the screen background is what most people would consider paperwhite. I might turn on warmth and reduce screen brightness when reading in bed, in a dark room next to my sleeping wife, but I am very happy with the screen white color and readability.

I purchased the optional 9W charger, and it took my battery from 50 to 99% in about an hour and a half.  It is a nice charger block.  It annoys me companies no longer supply free power cubes, but even Apple stopped supplying power cubes with their iPhones.  So, it is what it is.  I didn't wait for 100% because Li batteries are stressed and take a long time to get through the last bit of charging to get to absolute 100% charge.

The Amazon branded cloth cover is very nice, maybe a bit overpriced, but you get what you pay for.  The cover color perfectly matches the color of my kindle, it is thin and lightweight, fits snuggly, and it folds back out of the way when reading.  Compared to the old cover on my 2nd gen Kindle, this this one is much less bulky.  The texture of the cover makes it less likely I will drop it on the floor.  I'm glad I went with the Amazon cover.  Make sure you are ordering the correct cover.  If you buy a 2024, 12th edition Kindle, make sure you buy the cover for the 2024 Kindle, and not the 11th edition.

A word about the trade-in offer.  I found it a bit confusing.  It said 20% off with trade-in, but when I chose the trade-in, it only appraised the value of my very old 2nd gen Kindle at $5. I assumed the 20% was a max trade-in, but they gave me 20% off plus $5.  With the black-Friday pricing, it was  a great deal.

There was an offer on the webpage of three months free Kindle Unlimited, but after I worked through the trade-in and chose the three piece bundle (Kindle, cover, and charger). the offer disappeared.  When I received and turned on my Kindle for the first time, the same offer came on the screen.  So, no harm done.  Overall, I really like the new 2024 Paperwhite.  I highly recommend it.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2R9HAP1I7149U,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-27,35.0,positive,['great'],0.9956,electronics

So lets review THIS model.

The sliding response time is slightly slower than a phones and dragging your finger fully across the screen only gives you 1 single page turn. Not ten, you won't be missing chunks of the book you are reading because you moved your finger a bit. In fact it seems to only turn the page after you slide roughly an inch either left to right.

However single taps are only slightly less sensitive than the average phone, so if you repeatedly tap left or right you'll flip through pages quickly. Make of that what you will.

The feel of the screen is lovely, in the image I tried to capture the texture of the screen using a bright light, it didn't reflect the light much so it does have that glare-free thing going for it.

The screen brightness and contrast is nice, I can't speak to what it once was but it is more slightly yellow than my phone at max white, and that helps with eye-strain, but perhaps not aesthetic for some. While I've yet to need bifocals that day is coming soon so I personally prefer the ability to read longer without discomfort.

As for longevity and battery life, again this bad boy was released on Oct 16, 2024 and today is the 20th. I can say I charged it, connect to wi-fi- and downloaded a bunch of audio-books and various books and then read 15% of a book with the brightness at half and I'm at 95% battery life, which doesn't seem bad for the amount of downloading this did.

Weighs about as much as my phone with a case on it, is easy to read at angles, is easy to navigate and quick to wake up. Wish I'd timed how fast it charged but I plugged it in a made some bread and it was charged fully from 57% when I was done.

However, I'm a bit frustrated with the set-up on this one. Some of this is operator error -- I've been trying to download too many books at a time, which keeps freezing up the system. So that's on me (and why this version currently gets 4 stars instead of 3). But when I first registered my device (which went smoothly) and then opened up my library, I discovered all but a handful of my books (of which I have well over 2000) were showing up as unread or partially read even though I currently only have 2 unread books. At first I hoped that the system would catch up (this was prior to me downloading books onto the new Kindle) as my content library on Amazon showed the books correctly marked as ""read"", but that didn't seem to happen so I manually went through and marked them all as read. To be fair, I found a few errors in my organizing in doing this so was able to fix a few things. Still, it was a frustration and time consuming. I should note that I did check for and ran the update when I first started the Kindle, too.

After two restarts to unfreeze the Kindle (again, probably my fault from trying to download too many books at once) plus a third one when the screen suddenly prompted me to register my device again (after having already done it and having 775 books already downloaded), I am going much more slowly on downloading so hopefully the rest of the process will finally go more smoothly.

One other quirk was a couple books that had been placed in collections suddenly showed up in the uncollected folder. Not sure if I somehow accidentally removed them from their collections (don't see how, though) or what was going on.

Oh one other quirk I nearly forgot was that my library was showing that I had 42 library books even though all had been long returned. So I also had to re-return them as part of the process of getting this Kindle ready to use.

I'm guessing this next concern is because it was trying to download books last night, but it was fully charged at around midnight and when I checked it about 8am this morning, it was down to 7% battery charge.

I'm hopeful all will be fine when all is said and done, but what I thought was going to be an hour long process is well into the double digits of hours with work left to be done. Ah well, I'm sure once it's all done and I can focus on reading, this frustration will simply be an unpleasant memory.

Update: All is forgiven with the above noted issues as it is easier to use, the screen is nice sized so easier to read...just wonderful!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FXAH02LZG3RX,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7b42b720-3214-4ee3-9a82-de5f19eb39dd._CR0,0,442,442_SX48_.jpg",True,B0CFPJYX7P,2024-11-28,4.0,positive,[],0.9623,electronics

In early 2019 I got the Paperwhite 10th generation, which was really nice (300 dpi made a BIG difference, although I pined for the large screen of the DX).

When Amazon sent me a blurb to meet the new kindle family, I decided to get the 12th generation kindle paperwhite in teal (it is more of a turquoise/aqua, NOT a jade green, just saying) regular (non-signature) edition.

My other paperwhite still works so I decided to keep it and not trade it in.  This paperwhite isn't much more yellow, which is great (I don't like the yellow hue).  If I turn off the warmth, it looks VERY similar to the 10th generation.  I don't read at a beach or bathtub or pool so I'm not going to test the waterproof feature.

The kindle is very thin, and I felt sometimes on the 6"" screen that I was speedreading without meaning to (I only read fiction, and I have the font at 6 bookerly).  This 7"" screen is really nice.  It feels more natural and I can immerse myself better.

Also, imagine to my delight that when I set the kindle up I offered me three months of free kindle unlimited.  The selection on that plan has really expanded and I have a big wishlist (smiley).

I declined the audible 30 day free trial, but it offered that, too.

Now I'm just waiting for the snap back/magnetic front cases to have some pattern that I like.

I usually don't upgrade things until they break (still using a 4 1/2 year old iphone SE 2020 and 2019 ipad) but I'm really happy that I decided to just treat myself to this kindle.

My other kindle (the 2019 paperwhite) is nicknamed awesome kindle in my account; this one I nicknamed beautiful kindle.

I hope everyone else loves their kindle as much as me (and yes, I still read physical books, too).  I remember learning how to read; it opened a whole new world to me.  I don't read to the point of being anti-social (LOL), but I definitely enjoy it on the bus, on my lunch hour, and relaxing at home, and in much downtime (single, no kids, basic 40 hour a week job).

Thank you for reading.  I know many people are commenting on the kindle and I just felt inclined to join in.  I liked the keyboard, but physical buttons aren't a dealbreaker for me, and I also don't have trouble with the button on the bottom.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MS0NTCNLBPSH,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0CFPHV9ZN,2024-10-25,22.0,positive,['great'],0.9982,electronics
