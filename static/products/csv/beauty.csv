The two-part design makes it easy to apply, and the results are amazing—my skin feels softer, smoother, and more hydrated after each use. I highly recommend giving this one a try!

Here’s why I love it:

1. Easy to Apply:
The mask comes in two parts, which makes it much easier to adjust and fit comfortably on my face. No more struggling with a single, unwieldy mask—this split design ensures a better, more precise fit.

2. Effective Results:
I’ve only used it twice, but I can already tell that I absolutely love it. After applying the mask, I leave it on overnight (since the label suggests at least 4 hours of use), and when I wake up, the mask has become clear and almost invisible. It feels like the collagen has fully absorbed into my skin overnight, leaving my face feeling plump and refreshed.

3. Hydration and Rejuvenation:
In the morning, my skin feels noticeably hydrated and rejuvenated, with a smoother texture. I can tell it’s working to help nourish and revitalize my skin, which is a huge plus.

The only downside is the price, but given the results I’ve seen after just a couple of uses, I believe it's worth trying.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R387ONWXZ0F3UW,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/33998b4f-9887-4416-9870-f509d9a9e40d._CR0,0,499,499_SX48_.jpg",True,B0B2RM68G2,2024-11-12,80.0,positive,['love'],0.9877,beauty

Here’s How to Look Like Celebrities Who Don’t Age!,"I never really paid much attention to my skin care routine until recently. For years, I neglected my skin, thinking it wasn’t that important. But as I got older and started noticing more issues like dryness and dullness, I realized how crucial it is to take care of my skin. I wanted to do everything I could to prevent skin problems and look amazing. That’s when I discovered BIODANCE Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask and EVIL GOODS Whipped Beef Tallow and Honey Balm. These two products have completely transformed my skin, and I feel like I finally understand the importance of proper skincare.

Biodance mask is incredible. This hydrating overnight hydrogel mask does wonders for my skin. It’s designed to minimize pores, improve elasticity, and provide deep hydration. After using it for just a few weeks, I noticed a significant improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin. It felt softer, smoother, and looked more radiant. The mask is easy to use, and I love that I can apply it before bed and wake up with refreshed, glowing skin. It’s like giving my face a spa treatment at home!

It does move a tiny bit, but if you’re patient and hold it in places it doesn’t stick well, like your eye sockets by your nose, it will eventually do its thing within a short time.

The mask is large enough, but still small to where there are gaps of your face that go uncovered. I used the mouth, and eye pieces to cover the tiny areas of my face that the mask didn’t reach. Even overlapping the mask, my skin still absorbed everything. I have sensitive, and dry skin with semi-large pores. There is a distinct smell, but it didn’t bother me or my skin at all. When applying, the mask will be surprising more slippery coming from the package than when placing on your face. You do need to be careful with the mask, because it can be easily punctured or ripped if you are too rough trying to get it to reach beyond its limits. However, it easily goes back to its form if you don’t completely rip it, so just be careful. Punctures aren’t the end of the world and don’t change the efficiency of the mask.

After taking it off the next morning, I did see the difference between the skin on my face the mask reached, to the skin it didn’t. The mask made my skin hydrated, and softened my tired eye bags along with other tiny lines on my face. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does leave your skin shiny yet feeling sticky. I just splashed my face with water to make it less sticky from the mask residue, and that was enough for me to feel okay.

Overall, I recommend for occasional use, not daily or even weekly at their price point. There are other products that will absorb collagen into your skin much better, and cover your whole face without taking hours. However, if you have a special next-day occasion, or just want to pamper yourself because your skin needs the extra hydration, I do recommend mixing these in with your routine.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3C8DMZ73R8ZEQ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0B2RM68G2,2024-09-29,139.0,positive,[],0.9847,beauty

2nd mask, easy application, but didn't leave as much of the glow I was expecting from the first time around. Skin felt moisturized, but did nothing for my pores.

3rd mask, a bit difficult to put on to try and get t to fit like the others did so easily. Left on for 8 hours and skin was super hydrated and cool to the touch, but still pores remained the same and the glow went away after one day.

Wearing the last mask as we speak and it did NOT want to go on as well as the others did. Keeps sliding around so much that I'm just letting it stay wrinkled up because I can't do anything to get it to stay like I have with the others.

I decided to just go full boar with this and did all 4 masks in 1 week.
I slept with them all night (or as long as they would stay on my face) and after the third, I am seeing the results. Just like with anything, it has to get into your system before you start really getting the effects.
This raised it up to a 4 star. Reason it’s not 5 is the mask size. I really don’t think I have a large face but the mask does not fit well. I have to modify it quite a bit to get the coverage I need. The eye area is the worst and needs some improvement.

First of all, be careful removing this from the package. It is very delicate and you can puncture the mask very easily, especially those with nails.
The mask feels like a very thin piece of gelatinous calamari. The time the mask takes to hydrate is definitely awhile which gives the skins a lot of time to absorb the product. Overnight is best if you can sleep comfortably with it.

Does it make you look like you have poreless wet plastic skin like the adverts show on social media? The short answer is no. That would require injections from a medical spa. This is not a quick fix product by any means. But it does hydrate your skin. Once the mask is clear like Saran Wrap on your skin and it is removed, there is a (not pleasing) residue that is left behind. Your fingers do not glide smoothly across the skin like you just put a serum on it. It’s like a tacky feeling like wet glue. But after you wash this off, your skin should feel pretty smooth. But the advertised product videos the influencers are doing are definitely misleading. I’m not saying this product doesn’t hydrate the skin, but I have bought way cheaper face masks on Amazon that do a better job that you do not have to leave on all night.
But it was fun to see the hype.

The mask is not a 1 size fits all by any means.

Full disclosure - I've been trying to ramp up my retinol use so my skin is probably more sensitive than usual but the package said ""safe for sensitive skin"" so I figured it was fine. The minute I applied the mask on my face it started to burn a little but that subsided after about 5 minutes.  I carefully ensured there were no air bubbles under the mask and all areas were covered.  The upper part of the face mask initially looked like it would be too small but after smoothing it on it fit...in fact, it ended up being a little too large and the edges flipped up into my hairline. I went to bed and other than not being able to sleep on my side, it was actually pretty comfortable. There was a slight cooling effect which I thought it would be nice to wear it during the summer.  The next day, the mask turned clear and my face looked shiny but not that much plumper.  I performed my morning face wash with Cetaphil gentle cleanser and the minute I put on my regular lotions my face started to sting a little and turn pink. During the entire day my face felt a little hot and itchy, similar to the day after getting a mild chemical peel. Today is day 2 after using the Biodance mask and my face feels tight and there are patches of my face that are lightly peeling. I'm pretty sure it's a reaction to the mask and it's just not compatible for my skin.  Maybe if I wasn't using retinols it would be fine but I'd rather stick with my retinol regime.  Last thing worth mentioning...the marketing states the mask turns clear after your skin absorbs the ingredients of the mask but I noticed that the whole mask turns clear no matter if it was touching your skin including the edges that were lying on top of my hair.  So I don't think the mask turning clear is an indication that your skin absorbed all the serum, it's just evaporated.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RABWD6I6HH8LR,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0B2RM68G2,2024-10-31,3.0,positive,[],0.9916,beauty

This 3.38 fl. oz (100ml) essence is packed with snail mucin, which I was initially skeptical about, but it has proven to be quite effective.

Performance and Hydration: The essence delivers a powerful hydration boost, making my skin feel incredibly plump and nourished. I love how it tackles dryness and gives my skin a refreshed, healthy glow. Since incorporating it into my routine, I’ve noticed a visible improvement in my skin’s texture and a reduction in fine lines, which is exactly what I was hoping for.

Texture and Application: The texture might take a little getting used to—it’s a bit gel-like and has a slight sliminess due to the high snail mucin content. It feels a bit sticky initially, but it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. I’ve found it layers well with my other skincare products, so it fits nicely into both my morning and evening routines. It’s not a dealbreaker, but if you’re sensitive to textures, it might be a consideration.

Ingredients and Efficacy: I appreciate that this essence is formulated with 96% snail mucin and is free from artificial fragrances and dyes. It’s clear that the formulation is designed with skin health in mind, and it feels like a luxury treatment every time I use it. The additional hydrating and soothing ingredients work in harmony with the snail mucin to deliver noticeable results.

Drawback: One minor issue I’ve encountered is with the packaging. The pump sometimes doesn’t dispense the product evenly, which can be a bit annoying. I often find myself having to pump several times to get the right amount, which disrupts the otherwise smooth application process. Also, the slimy texture might feel unusual at first, but the benefits are worth it.

Overall Impression: Overall, the COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence has been a fantastic addition to my skincare lineup. It delivers impressive hydration and repair, and the snail mucin works wonders for my skin’s health and appearance. Despite a couple of small issues with the pump and texture, the results make it a worthwhile investment. If you’re on the fence about trying snail mucin, I’d definitely recommend giving this essence a shot—it’s made a significant difference for me.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13F9JKIOYV3HS,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B00PBX3L7K,2024-09-19,26.0,positive,['love'],0.998,beauty

I appreciate that it’s fragrance-free and gentle on my skin—I’ve never had any irritation from using it. It’s easy to apply: just stick it on before bed and remove it in the morning.

I am SO tired of having spots to cover and I'm in grad school with a mildly disabled kid and busy life overall, no time for the dermatologist right now. Last time there they recommended an OTC face wash that helped but not 100%. I've used these on more ""regular"" pimples I've already tried popping but I knew there was more there and I use them on new bumps that are deep under my skin (cystic? I think) and would take a long time to surface and then heal. I don't care what dermatologists say (one of my BFFs is one) I have to pop mine to get it all out before they start to heal. Often I have a more solid blockage that needs to be removed. These have eliminated ALL that. A red spot often remains for a few days after using the patch but there was clearly white on the patch and it's no longer raised or irritated. Easy to cover with makeup. I've used this on spots and not found any white on the next day but it still reduces the swelling and irritation. My husband can't see them on me 90% of the time too. When I put them on at night I wash and moisturize and wait a few min before putting the patch on but a few times I was too tired and rushed it. They still stayed on even if the edges weren't perfect. I used these on my 11 year old whose just starting to get some mild breakouts. I have VERY sensative skin and these don't irritate me at all. I've even used them during the day on weekends to speed things up if I wasn't going anywhere. So cool noticing the white spot slowly increasing as it works.

It's a struggle finding a good thick lotion that works for dry skin while smelling good. If I find that combo, it costs an arm and a leg. But the EOS lotion has been a miracle! I've began with the peach and love the scent. It's not too strong but I love a sweet fragrance and this is super feminine smelling without being too strong.

It dries fast without leaving you greasy. I apply it after my bath or shower and through out the day as I wash my hands bc it's so easy to use since it absorbs quickly.

eos Shea Better Fresh & Cozy Moisture Body Lotion
Morning light, dewy cassis and sheer musk
The fragrance of “Fresh & Cozy” is so simple yet anything but underwhelming. When you focus on the scent, it, to me, is the epitome of comfort. I highly appreciate it. This is the best out of the ones I’ve tried for the versatility. It’s not the loudest scent out of the line. It’s also not prettiest or overtly feminine scent in the world. But it’s the prettiest universal “clean”/low key scent I’ve ever smelled. It’s like pretty linens not just linens and that is obviously attributed to the cassis. I don’t have anything as refreshing yet feminine as this. Makes no sense how comforting it smells.

eos Shea Better Strawberry Dream Moisture Body Lotion
sparkling strawberry, pink sugar, and vanilla cream
I initially was disappointed by this scent because the strawberry note is not as strong as I was expecting and it doesn’t last on the skin but this is the best scent for my body chemistry and i really like the slightly creamy pink sugar smell that remains for hours, even until the next day, on my skin! It makes me feel really cute yet it’s not immature to me! It is BY FAR the longest lasting fragrance out of the ENTIRE line on me and It’s actually my favorite now after prolonged use. I get it now I was just impatient. I wanted to make it #1 but everyone’s taste is different.

eos Shea Better Pink Champagne Moisture Body Lotion
pear champagne, ruby pomegranate & plum suede
juicy, different. pretty. feminine. I had my mom put it on and it reaffirmed my opinion of it. the sillage and projection is much stronger on her. Smells very good and exotic. I haven’t always been into scented lotions so the notes in this are very intriguing to me. It’s just so good! It’s notes are loud and distinct on my skin yet the overall exotic scent doesn’t last as long on me. this definitely can be in 3rd place. but it’s not as versatile for my personality. It’s VERY pretty and unique. It doesn’t stand out on my skin as distinctly or as long as Strawberry Dream. It actually leaves my skin in an hour and what remains is a sheer pear/plum musky smell for an additional hour. Interesting. I don’t like categorizing scents by seasons but it definitely gives off summer vibes. I’m a Autumn/Winter girl.

eos Shea Better Coconut Waters Moisture Body Lotion
creamy coconut, lush hibiscus and solar musk
I am most surprised by this lotion as I tried to stay away from coconut scented products because they always smell like piña colada. I don’t want anything tropical. Like I mentioned before I love milky and creamy scents and I was hoping it would smell like coconut milk and for now this is as close as I’ll get. it is more creamy and musky than tropical and it’s overall really pretty. I like it more than Pink Champagne and wear it more. So creamy! The hibiscus in this definitely helps it. I find this to be more interesting than the vanilla cashmere as that one to me just smells like caramel. I also put a baby oil on top of this and i’m telling you it smells so creamy and yummy.

eos Shea Better Vanilla Cashmere Moisture Body Lotion
whipped vanilla, soft musk and cozy caramel
I love vanilla, I love cream, I love milk scents. This isn’t bad but I can see how someone sensitive to scented products would smell burnt plastic instead of caramel. It’s more caramel than vanilla. Surprisingly my least favorite. A true vanilla lotion would be the one from The Lotion Company. That one is straight vanilla bean. The caramel isn’t cozy to me and is too sweet. A very gummy burnt (not in a bad way) caramel scent. I like smelling like a snack but it’s a bit too much for me. It actually gives me a headache. There’s nothing soft or cozy about this. I think I find this to smell a bit too juvenile for me. It’s clearly about personal taste. I know many adults who like this. I think teenager every time I smell it. Strawberry Dream has a creaminess mixed into so I can take it a bit more seriously i guess.

eos Shea Better Jasmine Peach Moisture Body Lotion
apricot nectar, sparkling jasmine, and vanilla sugar
I was looking for some thing similar to the Johnson baby lotion in the pink bottle but without the green leafy note. It’s a bit feminine, but not powdery and babyish. You get more jasmine than peach. It’s basically jasmine with a sour undertone. It’s, so far, the least impressive out of the bunch. it’s also a bit screechy/pissy on me sometimes. Fresh & Cozy is stronger and lasts longer than this. The smell goes so fast and it’s not even that noticeable so I’m returning. I keep going nose blind to it. When I do smell it I’m just sure you can find something stronger and less simple at bath and body works and i don’t even shop there. It’s just not that good and I personally like jasmine as a fragrance note in perfumes. My mother likes it. It smells like grandma to me and I usually like scents that lean more sensual and/or mature.

eos Shea Better Pomegranate Raspberry Moisture Body Lotion
luscious pomegranate blended with tart raspberries and lotus blossom
It’s not bad. It’s not for my personality. Unlike Jasmine Peach, you can smell this one easily. Not interested in tart scents but thought I’d try anyway. It reminds me of a scent of hand sanitizer I would’ve gotten from bath and body works. It’s an average lotion scent and it’s not bad. Not my choice. if Jasmine Peach Was better I would prefer it over this if I was forced to choose.

~ OLD Update: I raised it a star. I like strawberry dream but when it dries it’s just pink sugar. Not much cream. no strawberry. It’s cute. not that interesting but my nose welcomed the smell a bit more and i won’t return it. i’m not *AS* disappointed. ~

OLD REVIEW ~
It’s more sugar and cream and hardly any strawberry. I can’t believe I like Pink Champagne more than Strawberry Dream. It’s not bad but it smells like sugar cookies or biscuits. I was hoping for a strawberry cupcake vibe. There’s no strawberry once rubbed in. You only smell it right out of the bottle. For Pink Champagne I give it 4.5 stars because although I don’t usually like fruity smells, plum is not that common of a fragrance note for me to associate it with anything childish or juvenile. Plum and pear smell quite good. Lol i’m only 23 but i don’t like smelling like Skittles. I really don’t regret buying that one! Especially because I have others in my collection so it’s a good addition. Vanillas, milks, and cream scents are really nice and Strawberry Dream is a basic sugary scent that I’m unimpressed by. Disappointing. It doesn’t smell bad it’s just not as interesting or strong as the other lotions. Even Fresh and Cozy is more unique than this. Good thing is these lotions are the only lotions I feel that don’t leave my skin dry or absorb instantly. It leaves a bit of lubrication behind on the skin and not just a thin “dry” layer of oil. A nice silky finish on the skin.

It only reminded me of yogurt because I heard on tiktok that some people said that’s what the smell had reminded them of. Honestly, it did smell underwhelming at first, maybe it was just a bad batch, but after i had let the lotion cool in my freezer it smelled heavenly. I got used to the smell after a few hours and now I constantly keep smelling myself it’s addicting. Now, I won’t say it’s the best scent ever and it is kind of overhyped but if you’re looking for a lotion that is subtle yet smells flavorful you should totally get it. The lotion smells very rich, creamy, sweet, yummy, and overall very scrumdiliumtious; especially when you apply it. On the other hand, it does smell kind of bitter or sour like a yogurt or milk from time to time so based on first impressions I’d say I wouldn’t have liked it. Like if someone were to wear this and hug me i’d think they smelt a bit weird you know but overtime it starts to smell good in a way I don’t know how to explain it. If you see this review and you still want to try it I warn you that it may smell either bad or good; it depends on the person honestly. Personally, I love it like a lottt but i do think it could use a stronger enhanced vanilla scent; so I am going to add some essential oils and add it into my bodycare routine to smell so edible and yummy. I’d say the lotion pairs well with most body oils, mists, perfumes, etc that al compliment that vanilla rich creaminess with a sweet and delicious flavor. If you are planning on using it alone only I’d say to not get it unless you’d wanna be dissatisfied. For like $8-9 though I’d say it’s worth trying out and if you like it you like it, but if you don’t you don’t. Now for the size comparison I’d say it is quite big, personally i think it’s worth it so once I run out I will be buying another. Like the size of the lotion is bigger than my hand which says a lot because my hands are quite big. Now if you’re planning on using this to moisturize your body, I’d say it is okay but there is much better lotions out there but it is good to add into your routine if you wanna smell like vanilla. It does leave a nice smooth texture on my skin though and it lasts for a good amount of time; the scent does last indeed. Now for the thickness i’d say it isn’t that light but it isn’t heavy weighted either, honestly feels like the texture of yogurt which is honestly a coincidence considering some people say it does in fact smell like yogurt. Now for the value for money i’d say it is really worth it considering the fact that it is quite big and costs less; definitely get it if you’re looking for an affordable lotion. Anyways, that’s about all, I hope my review did help you I know I would have for sure liked to hear this from someone else before I’d gotten it! Overall, I’m rating it a 3.5/5 which is basically a 7/10!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG7GJIRE55CSB,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B08KT2Z93D,2024-08-06,61.0,positive,['love'],0.9995,beauty

The baked formula is lightweight and blends seamlessly into my skin, providing a soft-focus effect that makes my complexion look fresh and flawless. I love how it controls shine throughout the day without looking cakey or heavy. A little goes a long way, so it lasts quite a while!

I particularly appreciate the color-correcting aspect, as it helps to neutralize redness and brighten dull areas, leaving my skin looking vibrant. It works beautifully on its own or as a setting powder over foundation.

JUST WOW. 4.5 out of 5; minus a little for no color/shade samples,"I'm almost 60/F, some wrinkles and a fair amount of discoloration, red spots, and sun damage, esp. on cheeks.

This foundation (baked balance and brighten, color FAIR) is really easy to use. Feels like nothing, even when building. I used only basic, soft, fluffy brushes I had on hand; they worked well for light coverage, but I do think a denser brush option -  like  a retracting kabuki, as recommended - might work better for building.

Very good coverage on bare skin (moisturizar only), pracrically perfect over an inexpensive primer. Almost all my flaws disappeared, even without concealer.

Did not settle in wrinkles, either. I FEEL PRET-TY, OH-SO PRET-TY!...or, at least, ""not bad for an old broad, not at all!"".

I do find that using primer is better over large pores and significant discoloration, such as have I. I used a budget brand with spf 30 and the foundation went on perfectly.

It's FAST, too. The longest part if the process is waiting for the primer to dry, maybe 1-3 minutes.

Found it difficult to shade match - but to be fair:  When is it *not* difficult?

Would be a very nice thing if Laura Geller Beauty offered an inexpensive ""sampler"" (say, $5.00 for just enough product for 1/2 face in two adjacent shades) to help in this process.

I tried ""PORCELAIN""  first, but it was just a tad too light. The model wearing ""FAIR"" looks like an olive tone to me, whereas (I think?) I'm more peachy, like the ""LIGHT"" model - but I'm super pale...but ... but.. hem ..haw..

Seems really wasteful to open, use once and return a full product to try a color that isn't quite right, as I have. ""Samplers"" would really help reduce the volume of product  returns, not to mention reduce waste and carbon footprints - just sayin'.

I saw quite a few advertisements and based off of reviews decided to give it a try. I’m 50 with quite a few blemishes from sun, diet, and just regular aging. The idea of doing away with foundation was pretty enticing. I decided to try the product with 2 different layers to compare. 1. Medium coverageM (using full brush) and 2. Full coverageF (using the stiffer brush). I chose Medium based on skin color and previous purchases from other reviews.
1st pics, No make-up, 2nd pics half my face with full coverage with the next pic showing my regular make-up (foundation + powder) and same for medium coverage.
Final judgement:  Matching skin tone is really hard. I don’t think the medium color complements my skin very well. In fact, I felt like the full coverage side revealed more of my blemishes and had more of an orange tint no matter how I decided to go - Full coverage vs. Light to medium; my skin even looked like it had an orangish tint to it.

I saw the commercials for this and thought I would try it. I want to address all three items in my heading since I have all that at the same time. My skin regiment includes a lot of anti wrinkle creams, retinol, and moisturizers, hence the acne I keep getting. I have gained and lost weight multiple times in my life so the wrinkles and textured skin followed.

First off this is too light to cover acne. I recommend a concealer first. I tried layering multiple times just to see if I could get the coverage I wanted. By the time the acne was hidden I looked awful lol. The powder caked way too much after all the layers.

Textured skin and wrinkles: moisturizer and foundation primer are a must! This powder is not the best for putting it right on textured skin especially if you want a little extra powder on some spots. It almost enhanced the textured skin I have on my chin. The foundation primer worked well for this and the wrinkles. You still can't put too much powder on or it will enhance what you are trying to minimize.

On the positive side I think the color I chose worked well and the powder is very light and feels nice on my skin. It does add a little luminescent to your complexion. I did go to the Laura Geller website to chose a color first. I bought this from Amazon due to the sale price and Prime shipping. It was not cracked or broken, and it was well packaged in bubble wrap. I picked a cute little retractable Kabuki brush by EcoTools on Amazon also and I love it! Only $8 too!

Overall I probably won't be buying this again. I was trying to find something that would shorten up my makeup regimen so I could skip the foundation.

Here’s an overview of its features, benefits, and potential drawbacks based on user feedback:

Features:

 • Heatless Curling: The primary benefit is its ability to curl your hair without damaging it with heat tools. It is made to be used while you sleep, saving time and minimizing heat exposure.
 • Satin Material: The satin fabric is gentle on the hair, reducing friction and frizz, which is especially useful for preventing breakage and maintaining smooth curls.
 • Includes Curling Rod & Scrunchies: The set typically comes with a long satin rod and matching satin scrunchies to secure the ends of your hair after wrapping them around the rod.
 • Comfort: Designed to be worn overnight, the satin material is soft against the scalp and comfortable while sleeping.

Benefits:

 • Prevents Heat Damage: Since it is heatless, it protects hair from the typical damage caused by heated styling tools like curling irons or straighteners.
 • Convenient: You can achieve curls overnight with minimal effort, making it ideal for busy mornings.
 • Frizz Control: The satin helps reduce frizz, leading to smoother, shinier curls.
 • Reusable: Eco-friendly since it’s a one-time purchase you can reuse as often as needed.

Drawbacks:

 • Results May Vary: Different hair textures and lengths may see varied results. Those with thicker hair may need more product or practice to get consistent curls.
 • Learning Curve: Some users report that it takes time to master the technique to ensure even curls without tangling or awkward positioning.
 • Sleeping Comfort: While soft, it may still take getting used to sleeping with the rod in place, and some users may find it slightly uncomfortable.

The Kitsch Satin Heatless Curling Set is an affordable, gentle way to achieve curls without heat damage.

MY STRAIGHT HAIR HAS CURLS!  I NEEDED 2.,"I’m 66 yrs old & have always had a hard time curling my hair.  It either doesn’t curl, the curls fall out, or it simply takes too long to curl it when I need to be somewhere.  I have a lot of hair & it’s long.  I tried curling it w/ one of these.  The front was fairly curly but the back was just ok.  So I bought another & now my hair looks evenly curled.  I put Kenra styling gel 17 in my wet hair & blow dry just my roots on a lg round brush where my part’s going to be.  I leave my hair damp & make a zig zag part down the center back.  My hair had a noticeable part at the top when dry when I made a straight part down the back.  Making a zig zag part before curling it gave me a better result.  It doesn’t have to be a perfect zig zag.  I use clips to keep the sections separate.  Then I separate the sides at the front of my ears.  I again use clips to keep the sections separate.  Then I put a Kitsch on top towards the back of my hair & start wrapping.  I run a comb through occasionally to keep my hair smooth & lightly spray the ends w/ water if they get dry before I finish wrapping them.  Once all my hair is wrapped, I will put a diffuser on my blow dryer & dry the root area just because my hair is so thick.  It sounds like a lot.  But I had it down the 2nd time I curled my hair.  These are incredible!  I sleep on my back.  So I don’t find them to be uncomfortable at all, even w/ 2 in my hair.  In the morning , I fluff my hair & use a light hairspray.

Sometimes, I just want something easy and quick, and these **Neutrogena Ultra-Soft Makeup Remover Wipes** have been a total lifesaver.

First off, they work *really* well. I wear waterproof mascara, and usually, it takes a lot of scrubbing to get that stuff off, but these wipes just melt it away without me having to tug at my skin. And they're super gentle around the eyes, which is huge since that area is so sensitive. I didn’t have any irritation, which can happen with other products, especially when I’m tired and don’t want to deal with anything harsh.

What I love most is how **moisturized** my skin feels after using them. I don’t feel like my face is tight or stripped of moisture like with other makeup removers. There's no greasy residue, but my skin feels soft, smooth, and refreshed. I’ve also noticed that I don’t need to rinse my face afterward, which is a total time-saver, especially at night when I just want to crash into bed.

Honestly, these wipes are perfect for people who don’t have a solid skincare routine (like me!) or anyone looking for a fast and easy way to take off makeup without all the extra steps. I can’t say enough about how convenient they are—grab a wipe, swipe away the day’s makeup, and you're done.

I bought this product to give one a try.

Pros

Does the job as advertised. The sugar grit makes my skin feel clean and fresh. There is a lot of product for the price, it is a pretty color, and it doesn't irritate my skin. It arrived quickly, didn't leak or crack open during shipping, and was one of a wide variety of scents and colors on offer.

Cons

Smells like a Yankee Candle farted, and unless the shower is rinsed off very well, makes that smell as well. This is especially irksome when real old-school farting occurs in the near vicinity, as happens in bathrooms. The resulting combination provides for a truly unique olfactory experience.

Super easy to use. The eyeshadow literally glides on very easily with zero drag. Immediate color payoff and for shades that really show up on your skin, you need just one swipe.  This part is definitely way better than the cheaper options (I've tried one other brand which was a fourth of the cost but is rough on my lids and requires a lot of back and forth to give me the same color payoff).

They last long. I have not seen any issues with color fading through the day with these.

Perfect for travel. I love throwing a couple of shades in my make up pouch without having to worry about packing a palette (and worrying about it opening and spilling all over) or brushes.

Cons:

As with any other make up product of course, some colors just don't match the payoff you see in advertised photos. Which wouldn't be as much of a problem if these weren't $15+ per eyeshadow.
I have four colors - the Smoky Tawny Matte and Ochre Matte barely show up on my lids. Although the advertised photos show color pay off on darker lids, I personally find it much lighter than the photos on mine (I have the typical south asian dark lids). Orchid shimmer and Sheer blush pink look amazing on my lids. Looks like the shimmer shades definitely help add some dimension to any base colored lids.

Personally the pros outweigh the cons for me and I love this product! I'll still use the shades that didn't give a lot of payoff for everyday looks. I use very few colors on my eyes so I'd much rather save money and buy more of these eyeshadow sticks than expensive palettes where I'll use maybe 2 out of 10-15 colors.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31VLO5G3GGRZP,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B088ZM3YF7,2024-10-16,25.0,positive,"['amazing', 'perfect', 'love']",0.9919,beauty

Color had unexpected glitter in it.,"I didn't get to try this out because I received a used item. (And it appears I'm not the only one.) I was able to get a close look at it, and I was immediately disappointed with the color ""mixture."" The item I selected wouldn't have worked for me, regardless of any other issue.

I've been curious about these eyeshadow sticks for a long time. I wanted to test them out years ago, but they seemed kind of pricey for my budget. I don't like to spend more than I'm used to on an item I have no certainty will work as claimed. But then my friend told me she bought a stick on discount, and it was a game changer for her. (Easy to use, easy to blend, buildable color, quick application, lasts long, looks natural, etc.) She said she bought more and suggested I at least try one. She insisted they were worth the regular price... finding one on discount was just a bonus. We're very much alike in what we look for in beauty cosmetics, so I was intrigued. I also saw there were a ton more reviews on Amazon than the last time I checked, and the majority of them seemed highly positive. So, I went for it. I felt I had the amount of guarantee I needed to justify testing this thing out.

I got the sheer shimmery pink color to use as a highlighter and on the inner corner of my eyes for a brightening effect. But that's not going to happen now. After I received my used product, I took a closer look at the reviews on Amazon - mostly to see if anyone mentioned unexpected problems with the same color I ordered. Instead, I noticed there were quite a bit of people who received what appeared to be used products, too!

This is highly disappointing considering this brand seemed to have made a good name for itself over the last few years. I was really excited to finally try their infamously convenient and water-resistant eyeshadow stick. You'd think they'd be more careful about the products they're sending out - especially for what they're charging.

My eyeshadow stick was undoubtedly used before I received it. Box was slightly crushed with signs of having been opened. The tip of the eyeshadow was smudged and there was product smeared on the outside of the barrel. If all that wasn't proof enough, the sponge tip had makeup residue on it as if someone fully tried every part of this thing out.

I can't speak for the application and wear quality of the item because I'm not willing to risk transferring potential bacteria to my eyes, face, or even the back of my hand. I can say the expectation of the product was not met, right off the bat. I can also add that I was surprised that there looked to be big chunks of glitter in the shimmery sheer pink eyeshadow and on the sponge tip. (I wasn't expecting such large specks of actual GLITTER to be in the mix. It wasn't shown on the advertised photos or explicitly stated that cheap glitter would be used. I did expect some fine mineral-like shimmer, but not cheap glitter.)

I'd suggest that if you buy this product, you thoroughly inspect it upon receiving it. Having cosmetics melt or break during shipment is one thing. But being sold a used product (advertised as new) is absolutely unacceptable. Especially,  when there's evidence of it be a reoccurring issue for this particular product.

I'm debating whether or not I want to try ordering another color - only because my friend was raving about this eyeshadow like it was the best product she has found to date. If I do decide to take another chance, I'd likely play it safe and choose a matte shade. I can handle some amount of ""shimmer,"" but I feel I'm a bit too old and I don't get dressed up enough to decorate my eyes with glitter. (I cannot stress enough: This was straight up large specks of GLITTER - almost like you'd find in a craft store or in young teens' cheap & trendy makeup - mixed in with an otherwise nice looking shimmery/pearlescent color.)

I'm just worried I'll get another used product... or that the product was otherwise kept in unsanitary/uncertain conditions before I received it. I just don't understand how this issue could happen so often. (Search thru the product reviews for yourself and count the number of complaints. You may not find it to be excessive, but I do. It really should be more of a rare occurrence. I haven't found this many complaints of used/questionable products when researching other cosmetics I'm also interested in trying.)

Also, avoid the shimmery sheer light pink color... unless you're ok with random large specks of glitter. Then maybe go for it.

The scent is really warm, pleasant, and potent. It is a mist, so the scent doesn't last long; however, I didnt expect the scent to have faded almost completely in 30 minutes (on plain, clean skin). One the bright side, it is affordable, so light reapplication on the hot spots every couple hours would be a nice addition to a layered scent profile.
Finally, the packaging is really nice for the price of the product. The bottle is a hard plastic, but still feels quality. The biggest plus for me is the spray straw that reaches all the way to the bottom of the container so you can enjoy every last drop. Details matter and this passed.

I don't keep them in the fridge but they still give off a cooling feel. When I catch a glimpse of myself throughout the day, my puffy undereye area isn't what I notice first anymore which is a huge win. BUT, they are so frustrating to deal with!

First, it doesn't matter what I do when I open the package, one or both of the pads stick to the inside of the plastic pouch instead of sliding out on the little tray they sit in. You're supposed to put the flat side on your skin, and that's the side that gets stuck to the plastic, which makes me feel like product is being lost.

Also, as other reviewers have noted, they slide down! They don't fall off - they slide just enough to move off of the targeted undereye area, but not enough that you can tell just based off of how they feel sitting on your face. I have to keep checking the mirror and readjusting them constantly which is very inconvenient during a busy morning.

It goes on easily and with a little time to react with my skin, it looks like natural, healthy skin -- not makeup. Trial and error with the shade matching is inevitable. Plus it's summer and if you're spending time outdoors (like me), different shades may match at different times

I've never liked makeup -- probably bc as a teenager I watched my mother do her makeup for hours every morning and swore I'd never get up early to waste that much time making myself up for anyone. Fast forward 30 years -- while I would still go completely makeup-less if I could, dark spots/age spots/acne scars have forced me to consider a light approach to makeup. Plus I've been convinced that sunscreen is a must to fend off any further aging, so my late 40s makeup journey started with the search for the perfect tinted mineral sunscreen.

For people who say this is too heavy or cakey, I disagree. You can use a very light touch with this, you just need to not squish the puff down hard into the compact's cushion. I'm able to dab very lightly into the cushion, and if I get too much, I pat it off on the inside of the black flap that covers the cushion. If it looks wet on my skin, I know I've put too much on. I'm able to achieve enough coverage to even out redness and cover spots/blemishes without looking or feeling like I'm wearing heavy makeup. Since I'm oily/combination, I'll powder lightly (with either Morphe Soft Focus translucent setting powder or Hourglass Vanish pressed powder in translucent tan). If it looks too matte after the powder or if it's a really hot day, I'll spray TirTir's Mask Fit Makeup Cool Fixer (the cooling effect is so nice -- I wish Amazon sold this). Immediately after application, I think the cushion foundation looks a little ""flat"" (even with highlighter and contour/bronzer), but with time, it must react with my skin and it starts to look like glowy, healthy skin.

For people who are taking stars off bc of color matching -- you're buying makeup online -- no monitor or phone screen is going to accurately display a makeup color. So unless you're able to try this in person, it's going to be trial and error ordering online. I've gone through 6 shades (and 2 sample packs); aside from the 1st 2 shades not matching me, the others have been because it's summer and I'm getting darker as I spend more time outside. I have medium to tan skin with warm undertones -- this is the order of the shades I've tried and when I tried them:

27N Camel (mid-May): too yellow/olive for me. Also seemed to oxidize orange-ish on me

25N Mocha (late May): less yellow/olive than 27N Camel, but also too light on me

9-shade original sample pack (early June): sampled 24N Latte and 29N Natural Beige from the packets next to 25N Mocha from the compact. Both 24N and 29N seemed like potential matches. 25N was still too light. Instead of smearing on wet, I tried to press the sample makeup into my skin to mimic if I was using the puff and cushion compact; I'm convinced that the samples are okay to test colors, but don't represent the colors exactly as they come out of the cushion compact

27C Cool Beige (early June): TirTir released new shades so I wanted to see how this compared to 27N. 27C isn't really ""cool""; it’s more peach-y and not as yellow/olive as 27N. It was a good match when I tried it. But this shade felt more drying than the previous cushions. I was coming off a week of antibiotics so maybe the meds dried me out, or maybe the newer shades are a different formulation?

24N Latte/29N Natural Beige (2nd week of June): got the compacts of these. Both were decent matches but I could see that 24N would be too light as the summer went on; 24N still seemed darker on me than 25N Mocha. 29N became my go-to shade for the next few weeks

6-shade medium sample pack (late June): ordered this to try the darkest shades in the pack, 30N Rich Honey and 31N French Beige. 31N was too dark for me and 30N was just a hair darker than my skin at that time

30N Rich Honey (mid-July): ordered 30N during the Prime day sale and it's been my go-to shade since then (it's now early August)

I totally expect that as we go into fall, I'll revisit the lighter shades as my summer tan fades. 

I was initially drawn to these red cushion foundations because they were supposedly SPF 40 when there were only 3 shades, and unlike most tinted sunscreens, I wouldn't have to get it all over my hands to apply. However, the US packaging doesn't mention SPF, so I prep as if these have no SPF. I prep with TirTir's Milk Skin Toner Light (I chose the Light for my oily/combination skin -- love what this has done for my skin). Then a vitamin C serum (not TirTir), Baebody eye gel, then Baebody eye cream. Next, If I'm not going outdoors at all, I'll use Drmtlgy's Water Creme moisturizer, then apply the cushion foundation. If I'll be outside for only a short amount of time, I'll use LiveTinted Huegard 3-in-1 SPF 30, then the cushion foundation. If I'll be outdoors for an extended amount of time, I'll apply the cushion foundation after the Water Creme moisturizer and TirTir's Mask Fit (Blue) Cool Sun Cushion SPF 50+ -- I wish Amazon sold this. It's one shade and does start off too light on me, but I can pat it in and it leaves just a minimal lighter cast on me. I love that it's sun protection that I can apply with a puff and not my bare hands. I've never had any issues with the red cushion foundation pilling over any of these different products.

With trial and error for shade matching and to get your desired amount of coverage, this TirTir red cushion foundation is an amazing product. 100% recommend the sample packs (if they're available) or the mini compacts to test shades, and also recommend TirTir's Milk Skin Toner Light, Mask Fit Makeup Cool Fixer, and Mask Fit Cool Sun Cushion (Amazon please please please start carrying these 2 Cool items!)",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Q08V3CFSBI5E,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0D58K45NC,2024-08-04,367.0,positive,"['amazing', 'perfect', 'love']",0.9985,beauty

BUT....,"I absolutely LOVE this foundation!! You have no idea how wonderful it is to FINALLY find an affordable foundation that matches my skin tone PERFECTLY. As a ""woman of a certain age"" (let's leave it at that!) my only choices when I first started wearing makeup were the only department store foundation made exclusively for Black women (before there was ever Fenty) or settle for weird looking drugstore foundation matches. And who would have thunk it would be a South Korean makeup company that would finally match my skin tone all these years later!

I purchased shade 40N and 43N (at the time the two darkest TIR TIR shades). I got 43N because it was what a You Tube influencer that I follow used (MissDarcei) who is my exact shade in both summer and winter. When I heard that the foundation oxidizes a shade darker, I went with 40N first. As it turns out, 40N will work great for my winter shade.

There are tutorials on You Tube on how to best apply this foundation to get the best results. Robert Welsh is a great place to start.

As far as wear goes, I have done makeup tests with the foundation on my face bare skin and without primer and with skin care prep, and it looked as good as it did when I put it on. I wore this foundation for up to 12 - 15 hours each time, and the only thing that happened was that I did start looking a little ""dewy"" in my T-zone around hour 10, but nothing that a quick dab of powder wouldn't fix. The foundation never separated, never looked cakey, and didn't fill in any lines. It also played nicely with my concealer, etc.

1. It didn't separate even after almost 15 hours, which was the day I wore it just on my face and with nothing else on underneath it.

2. It didn't settle into my laugh lines or any fine lines.

3. There was very minimal transfer, and what transferred were things like blush and highlight. The foundation itself had practically no transfer.

4. The longer it was on my face, the better it looked, and it looked fantastic to start. Plus my skin looked great when I removed it.

5. It stayed on my face until I took it off, and this was even through gardening, running errands, and going out into a heat wave.

IMPORTANT TIPS TO REMEMBER:

1. DON'T keep constantly keep pressing into the foundation. When they say a little goes a long way, they mean it. Press the applicator LIGHTLY once into the cushion so that you can barely see the foundation on the applicator. If you can see it, tap the excess off on the inside of the cover. It is buildable, so start with a very light layer, which will be more than enough to do your whole face. You should be able to lightly press into the compact and use that little bit to cover your whole face, and if you miss a spot or two, pick up the excess that you wiped on the inside cover and use that.

2. If the foundation looks cakey or orange, you applied WAY too much to the pad and piled the excess right onto your face. The more you apply in the very first application, the more it will oxidize and give you cake-face.

3. DON'T drag the applicator sponge across your face. That's another reason why you have cake face and look like an Oompa-Loompa. TAP the sponge into your face, starting from the center and work outward.

4. DO NOT use a foundation brush or beauty blender to apply this foundation. This will also give you cake-face because you're using too much foundation all at once.

4. SKIN PREP IS KEY! I have combo/oily skin, so I did my skin prep (clean skin, moisturizer, primer for oily skin), let it sit and soak in for 5-10 minutes, and then applied this foundation. If you have oily skin, set this foundation with powder.

5. Wait for the foundation to set before you apply anything on top of it. It dries down fast, especially if you apply it the right way.

6. Go a shade lighter than you think you'll need. Even with the light application, it does oxidize like any other makeup does. It will oxidize a shade darker. And again, if you put on too much, you will turn orange.

I had no breakouts or flaky skin anywhere with this foundation. I think the people having problems with this foundation should address it through their skin prep. Of course there are people who will be allergic and who can't use the foundation, but I think the majority of people complaining about how the foundation looks don't know how to apply it correctly.

TL:DR - Absolutely love this foundation; 10 out of 10 would recommend.

UPDATE AND EDIT ON 8/27/2024:

TL:DR - I still like this foundation, but I got one of the recent shade updates (45W Chestnut), and it was a swing and a miss. I got a bit darker than anticipated because - SUMMER- and was really excited that a warm shade had come out. I pre-ordered it, got two compacts of the new shade b/c I remembered how quickly they sold out, and got one of the first batches.

Way, WAY too red. And when it oxidized, my face was two shades darker than my ears! Even after applying the foundation using the techniques I outlined earlier.

Do I still like the product? Yes. I like the coverage, I like the wear-ability, I like how it feels on my skin. But if you're still listening, Tir-Tir, please make warm AND cool shades, especially in the deeper skin tones. POC have different undertones, and not all dark people have red undertones.

I appreciate that you've been receptive to our requests thus far, but you're almost there with the shade range!

Decided to switch to Korean makeup after switching to Korean skincare and seeing a big improvement in my combo, acne prone, easily pigmented skin. I’ve been wearing this daily for 3 months, and I’ve only seen improvements in my skin. I have no plans to go back to any of the other foundations that I used previously (Lancôme teint idole, L’Oréal infallible, Dior forever skin glow, Maybelline super stay skin tint, Armani luminous silk) because this seems not at all pore-clogging, more natural looking, and stays well. This is also way easier to apply and makes doing my foundation really quick.

A little bit goes a long way—youtube videos explain that you need to pat the applicator back on the black plastic after picking up foundation off the cushion to take the excess off before applying. Doing this allows you to get good coverage from a thin layer without using too much. It’s buildable if you have an area that needs more coverage.

I do not use primer with this—I just let my BOJ sunscreen dry down, apply the foundation in a single thin layer, add another thin layer anywhere that needs more coverage, do the rest of my makeup, set with setting spray, and it sits really well all day, even through a workout.

I also find that it can be full coverage enough to conceal my under eyes with a few thin layers, but for a more glam look it works well with Tarte shape tape and Kosas concealer.

The only minor con is that I feel even the neutral shades skew warm, but it is nice that they have the trial packets, mini sizes, and a vast shade range.

I’ve also found that when I think I’m out of foundation, the sponge inside palette can be flipped over with tweezers and you’ll get a few more uses while you wait for your replacement to ship.

YMMV but I personally won’t ever feel the need to try another foundation for as long as this is available.

I'm telling you, if u find your ri match..you will love this product!! I don't even want to go bck to wht I was using lol its become back up! This application is easier to deal with vs liquid...

But I need a tester sheet before I can move foward with any new shades & they are sold out..so i hope they are bringing in more. This is the most expensive foundation I've purchased IF I get the bigger size, but I wonder how much product there is because the 15$ doesn't seem like it's gona have longevity if you use it as an everyday..which makes no sense, when i use it lightly...so I will get the bigger size in the shade I know for sure that matches & see what happens...but

I wish I was born with red hair so it would make more sense to be so pale. 😅  It's almost impossible for me to find a shade match that doesn't oxidize too dark.

I love this formula, but both of their #13 shades were still a bit too dark. I was so excited to see a new #10 lighter shade, and the photos looked like it was going to be perfect for me... It was WAY too light, which was kind of shocking!

Hopefully they come out with some shades that are between 13 and 10 for us fair folks, because this is the best foundation I've ever tried. I'm very picky, and want something with good coverage that looks like skin and can hold up on my oily skin. This does it all for me!

I use a dampened pawpaw beauty blender sponge after applying with their included applicator - it gives the most natural skin look. Their little flat sponge doesn't bounce it into my skin the way I need it to, but I also don't want to waste product by dunking my beauty blender into the compact. 😉 Using theirs to apply and mine to blend works like a dream!

I have to set it with a powder for my oily skin, but I get such a smooth finish! Love love love!! It's much more transfer proof than the average foundation - definitely give it a try!

If you're oily like me, blotting sheets should always be with you in your purse. They will absorb excess oil halfway through the day, and your makeup will still look fresh and lovely for 12+ hours. So grateful I finally found a combination that works for me after all these years! My makeup used to start melting off within 4-6 hours and I thought there was no hope... 😅

13c is the lightest shade that works for me with a light/brightening powder right now, and I hope to see more light shade options in the future! ❤️

I used to braid my hair at night but that made the frizz worse and was causing a permanent wave. So years ago I decided to try a bonnet. I fell in love with it, used it for years, but it became very loose and falling off overnight, defeating the purpose. So I bought this as a replacement.

First, the silk is very nice and it's not really just 'silk lined' making it heavier, it's all one piece. It has a very comfortable flat band on the edge. The ribbon is a cute touch.

Second, I had some issues. First problem - I am not cultural or fancy enough to fully understand how to tie the elegant bow like the model is showing. I am a very boring, very white girl. At first try, it flopped into my face. I tried adjusting it slightly, here and there, and eventually gave up and just tied it in the back to lay on my neck. I thought this would be an issue sleeping but it wasn't uncomfortable.

What I did have an issue with at first is that while the cap is very roomy for even the largest hair styles, or probably even curlers/rollers in shorter hair, the band was veryyy tight. Uncomfortably tight. I wasn't sure I would last the night and hesitated using it the following night. This may be because I was used to such a loose cap that it doubled as a sleep visor, but still important to note.

I've come to a compromise with it. I don't use it every night, but I will use it on wash days when I use leave in conditioner. The band loosened probably quicker than it should, but it's more tolerable now while still secure. It is also very silky while still breathable so my hair is always very nice the following morning. Then I usually swap out to a different one until the next wash day.

The other thing I want to mention is with my old bonnet and the more recent updated model of it I eventually bought as a replacement, I felt it was fashionable enough to be seen in public for a quick errand or a trip through the drive thru. I cannot do that with this bonnet. It may be because I can't master the elegant bow on top, but I also don't have enough hair to fill it out completely, so it's kind of floppy on my head. I'll wear it to bed, but I'm not wearing it in public. This may not be an issue if your hair type or style fills it out better than mine.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IVY6UI9XC0VO,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B0BLYFFMSV,2024-05-01,184.0,positive,['love'],0.96,beauty

While regrettably it will be an additional errand to mail it back, it’s a kind offer and it gives me a lot of respect for this vendor. I wish to reiterate how nice it feels to wear a sleep bonnet made of real silk, and it’s unlikely I will ever return to wearing a synthetic sleep bonnet again in the future, now that I see what a nice difference the silk makes for the comfort of sleeping and care for both hair and skin. I’m 61 and while my body is aging as everyone does, who has the privilege of growing older, I still keep my long hair in nice condition, thanks to the nightly habit of wearing a sleep bonnet to protect my hair. I learned this trick from my best friend who happens to be black, and the hair protection that is afforded by regular use of a protective bonnet for sleeping has been of tremendous benefit to my hair, which is the typical White people hair of Eastern and Northern Europe, its thin, very very fine, oily scalp and dry split ends. I stopped washing hair with any shampoo that contains sodium laurel sulfate, I never use heat to dry or “style”, I use only henna, never any chemical dye for coloring and I wait a day or two between washings. Since learning how to take care of my hair, I have been able to grow it longer and healthier now than it was in my 30’s. Good nutrition is obviously important. But protecting the hair strands from breakage while sleeping has made a bigger difference than I ever imagined it would. THANK YOU, SILK SLEEP BONNETS!

I have this silk night bonnet hair protector in the standard configuration (adjustable elastic band) and I can see the structural reasoning behind placing these tie ribbon things the way they were placed. The bow can be cute. The style may be more traditional, harking back to when elastic wasn’t available. I just find this design a bit on the slippery slidey fall-off-your-head in the middle of the night. I love the real pure silk, not going to give that up, life’s too short for cheap materials next to my face.

Great for everyone,"Best bonnet I've found so far. Stays on the most. I'm still trying to figure it out fully so it falls off some nights. But it's super stretchy and doesn't give me a headache like other ones have. Adjusting the tightness is easy if I do tie it too tight. If you're a active sleeper like my kiddo tho she will pull it off in her sleep. The more we have worn it and gotten used to it tho the less she's pulling it off.

I sleep so much better without my hair wrapping around my neck/face or getting stuck under my shoulder or pulled by my little. I haven't woken up with gross sweaty hair once since using it.

And this isn't even touching the fact that my hair is less frizzy and healthier since I've started to use the bonnet. The only problem I'm trying to figure out is that the front of my part gets messy. But I think that's because of how I sleep or maybe how I'm tieing it on. Definitely a learning curve! But worth it

Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole is an outstanding solution for those dealing with dandruff and scalp issues. The active ingredient, ketoconazole, is proven to effectively treat dandruff by targeting the root cause—fungus on the scalp. After using it just a couple of times a week, I noticed a dramatic reduction in flakiness and itchiness, leaving my scalp feeling clean and refreshed.

The shampoo has a pleasant, fresh scent that isn't overpowering, and it lathers well, allowing for easy application. It leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable without drying it out, which is a plus for a medicated shampoo. The 7 fl oz bottle provides plenty of product, especially since it only needs to be used twice a week to see results.

For anyone struggling with persistent dandruff, Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is highly effective and worth every penny. It's gentle, smells great, and works fast—highly recommended for long-term dandruff relief!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R165LZVN0LQK4M,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/c29ffd95-3813-4b20-9282-60e938dcc00b._CR94,0,312,312_SX48_.jpg",True,B00AINMFAC,2024-11-05,12.0,positive,['great'],0.9911,beauty

If this shampoo helps with your dandruff and flaking, and you have similar symptoms in other places on your face/body (e.g. beard/moustache/eyebrows, chest, armpit) apply this on those spots too, it will help. Obviously make an effort to not get this in your eyes.

While the shampoo itself is great and has become essential, I'd like to state for potential buyers that this shampoo will leave your hair VERY dry, so be sure to use a conditioner or some other hair moisturizing product after it. I usually apply the shampoo, wait for about 5 minutes, wash the hair properly, then use the Nizoral conditioner. My hair ends up feeling amazing.

Back Story:

So about 2 years ago, I started getting dry skin around my mouth, nose, eyebrows, and occasionally my ears and cheeks. It was pretty mild, so I never went to a dermatologist. However, before this time, never did I have to lotion my skin regularly, so this was a change for me.

When this started happening, I used Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Advanced Therapy), and while it made me look greasy or like I was sweating for a couple hours, lol, it wore off enough, and would leave me looking normal the rest of the day. The only time my skin was really irritated was right after I would shave. However, dryness/peeling would get real bad if I did not at least lotion all those areas of my face after I showered. While I did some minor Googling about the issue, I was clearly too lazy to do anything about it, and the lotion solution sufficed for me. Dumb, I know.

Anyways, fast forward to about 1.5 months ago. I started to notice a white growth under my left thumbnail that started to detach my nail from my nail bed. For some reason, this concerned me more than the dry skin on my face. So after Googling again, I found ti could be a problem with yeast growth under my nail. Then, I remembered reading that yeast growth could be causing my face problems. After connecting the dots, I decided to find a possible solution, to possibly kill two birds with one stone.

After some searching, I stumbled onto Nizoral. After reading all the reviews, I was encouraged. I purchased this product and it has helped me tremendously. I could not be happier. It says to use it only every 3-4 days, which I say you should stick to, because I would use it on back to back days and it would seem to dry my skin out, but that could have been in my head.

My Use:

So, I know this is shampoo, but I almost treat it like liquid soap. I rub it on my skin/scalp and leave it there for 3-5 minutes. For my fingernail, I would lift it, since there was a gap and the nail was coming up. I put Nizarol directly in the ever so small opening between the nail and nail bed, and left it for 3-5 minutes. I am not sure if that was smart for the fingernail, but it worked for me.

Results:

TLDR: It worked everywhere, lol.

Mouth/Upper Lip: This area was the worst of my dry skin issues. Like said, it was especially bad after shaving. Sometimes, my skin would be patchy red and inflamed after shaving, especially on the top of my chin and right below my lip. It would look gross for like an hour. In addition, when I did not shave, but did not lotion my skin, this area would eventually get pretty flaky before the end of the day. I also had issues with the corners of my mouth, especially after eating. My upper lip generally did not have any issues, but sometimes I would in very cold/dry weather.

So, after using this product, I have seen a great deal of improvement. For the first time in almost 2 years, I do not have to lotion my face every single day. The patch below my lip still is not where I want it to be, but it is very much better. My skin feels dry after a shave, but now it does not look red or inflamed. It is getting better, and I think it will continue to get better. The corners of my mouth have issues if I do not lotion for 2 days or so, but they are much more minor to what they used to be. The minor issue above my lip is currently non-existent, however, we have not had any cold weather yet. This was the most noticeable problem I had with my dry/flaky/peeling skin, and I am happy to say, Nizarol has worked wonders. I now can use regular lotion instead of Aquaphor, which I still adore.

Eyebrows: This was my second worse area, and I say eyebrows, but it was actually the area in between my eyebrows would flake worse than my eyebrows. I rub Nizarol into my eyebrows, in between them, and around my eye sockets. Nizarol has pretty much cleared up this issue, and I am thrilled Nizarol has basically eliminated the second worst dry area on my face. If I do not use lotion for several days, it does flake, but in a very minor way. Side note: be careful around your eyes, it burns pretty good if you get the shampoo runoff in your eye, lol.

Nose/Nostrils: This was my third worst area. I would have dry skin on the sides of my nose, the point of my nose, and even on the inside of my nostrils! First off, putting Nizarol in your nostrils may not be safe. If you do do it, don't huff the Nizarol when it is in your nostrils, breath through your mouth. My nose area has improved, but is now more of an issue than my eyebrows. Still it is much better, and I can go a couple days without using lotion. It is also more of the inside of the nostrils than the outside of my nose. I think if I were willing to put Nizarol further up my nose than just the inside rim, I could eliminate the problem. But, at what cost? Lol. I don't want to ingest this stuff, lol. Either way, I am still happy!

Head/Scalp: I have never had much of an issue with my scalp other than minor dandruff, for which I have always used Head & Shoulders. Despite this, I use this shampoo, as intended. I can not honestly tell if it is making any difference. Also, I have very short hair, so I cannot tell if this makes my hair coarse like everyone else says. If it does, I would use a conditioner like other reviews suggest.

Ears/Earlobes:  So, while it was more rare, but sometimes, my ear lobes and the bottom crease where the ear connected to my face would get dry and flake. I rub Nizarol on my ears, on the inside of my ears, and behind my ears/ear lobes. I have zero issues here now and never have to lotion this area any more.

Forehead/Cheek Areas:These were not really problem areas unless it was cold/dry/windy. We have not had that type of weather, but I really do not think it will be a problem.

Pelvic Area: I know this is a touchy subject, lol, but  what I have to say is tame and could help some people. So several months back, something new happened, I noticed my pelvic area was dry as well, after using clippers. I used Nizarol in the creases of my leg, and in in my pelvic area, including directly on my -----. Results? Well, this has virtually eliminated the dry skin everywhere. Even better, I am chaffing less when running, which is awesome! I figured Nizarol was working everywhere else, so what the hell? Luckily for me, this was another minor issue it helped.

Fingernail: Getting back to my fingernail, I had this white chalky/flaky formation under my fingernail. It had got to almost halfway down my thumbnail. It was causing my nail to lift. It did not hurt, but I thought it was unsightly. So I lifted the nail and put Nizarol in there. Again, possibly not safe, but a couple weeks in and my nail is almost back to normal. I eventually started cutting deeper into my nail to get the Nizarol farther back, which has worked. My nail almost looks normal and it looks like it is pushing the last of white to the font of my nail. So the growth stopped moving backward and it has improved. Another win!

Others Uses?: As you can tell, I pretty much use this stuff all over. I put it on my elbows, the knuckles of my toes, and the point of my ankle bone. I think it is helping, but I am not 100% sure. What I can tell you is that it seems that it seems easier to get the dry skin off after applying the shampoo. A pedicure is on the docket and if I remember, I will update this review.

Conclusion:

Nizarol has worked way better than I could have hoped, and I did not even have to go to the dermatologist. I am hoping within a couple months, my skin will go back to normal. I am not sure if that will happen, but I love what Nizarol has done for me. I encourage anyone that has some of the issues I had to give it a try. Again, my issues were mild compared to some of the pictures I have seen, but I imagine if you are struggling with mild to intermediate issues, and you have not gone to a dermatologist, this could help you.
I hope all this helps! Good luck!

****Update: 7/25/2017***

Fingernails: Nizoral completely fixed my nail problem!

Face: So, when I first started using this product, I saw quite a bit of improvement. I no longer have red patches anywhere on my face. The only issue is that there have been diminishing returns. Nizarol has helped tremendously, but I still have dryness and dead skin issues. It is much more mild now, but still exists, however, I am grateful for the continued results.

Scalp: Lol, I still cannot tell if this is helping or not. I still have minor dandruff. Nizarol has had no effect on my scalp as far as I can tell.

I started getting dandruff in my late 20's. I'm 36 now. At first it wasn't bad and then it got noticeable to the point I was embarrassed. For reference I have really dark brown hair, thick and very long. I had literally tried every kind of dandruff shampoo and conditioner from stores to online to salon recommended. From $5 bottles to $35 plus. The only way they would remotely work is if I used them daily, but by the end of the day or next morning, I'd have the ugly white flaking or white piece stuck in the middle of a strand of hair. If I went two days without using them, it would be enough to notice even with my hair in a bun And headband. And I usually wash my hair every 3-4 days because I never needed to wash it daily.
I randomly searched on Amazon again about a month or two ago for dandruff shampoo because now it was getting itchy and I was so upset every day to see my hair. I found this product with high reviews, Nizoral. I said to myself, I'm desperate and I'll try anything. I purchased it. When I first went to use it, it was super blue and I wasn't sure how it would leave my hair, but I scrubbed it all around my scalp, only one wash. Then I used my normal conditioner, Nexxus, not any kind of anti dandruff conditioner (because I have those too). I wanted to see what the Nizoral would do without also having to use an anti dandruff conditioner. And for another reference (there's a lot of these), I first used it after not washing my hair for about 3-4 days, with only using dry shampoo in between. I got out of the shower and didn't see white flakes. I let my hair dry naturally as I wasn't going anywhere and drying it is a 30-40 minute process which I don't like doing lol. But I love my long hair; it's a love/hate relationship.
Anyways, back to this magical shampoo, I woke up the next morning and no flakes, no white stuck in strands of my hair, no grossness falling out of my hair onto my sink or clothing when I ran my hands through my hair or brushed it, nothing! I was so excited, but hesitant because I said let's give this the day test. Checked back at night, nothing. Checked the next morning, nothing. I went 4 days without one single flake before my head was a little itchy because of just needing to be washed.
I repeated the Nizoral shampoo with my normal conditioner again, and same thing. Days and no flakes or itching. I literally cried I was so happy and couldn't believe the type of sorcery this product had bestowed upon my head.
I am now on month 2 or 3 I think, and I use this once a week with my regular conditioner and the dandruff is just gone. And that is days in between without washing my hair. It also doesn't make my hair dry or feel gunky or anything. My hair is always soft and smells nice. I was worried something like this would give off a weird medicated kind of smell, but not at all!
If you have dandruff and nothing has worked or your tired of having to use something every day in order for it to work, just stop and buy this. It's not even that expensive and I have had two months of use from ONE bottle; again with that reference, I have hair down to my bum that takes 40 fricken minutes to dry with a blow dryer because it's so thick.
Hands down I would literally promote this shampoo anywhere, even though my dandruff has been a really embarrassing condition for me. I wish I had before and after photos, but my dandruff was pretty much gone after the first use. So I couldn't even get a before picture now and it hasn't come back.
Seriously, if you made it this far, Just buy it!

** Also, quick footnote, I do shower daily. I just don't wash my hair every day. It goes up in a tight bun on my hair days off in the shower, which usually will stay up the rest of the day because I work from home and between being a single Mom getting a 7 year old up and ready for school and morning chores and then working for 10-12 hours, I'm too lazy to style my hair. Now, I do use a  normal dry shampoo in between hair washes. But I had that routine before I bought this product, so I know 100% the only reason my dandruff is gone is because of the Nizoral shampoo.

*** Second footnote, I'm not being paid to write this nor was this some kind of promotional item I got to use to write about. I'm just that impressed and so happy with the results and I know there has to be someone else out there that is going through that struggle I did and I just want that person to feel the happiness I do right now.

It is PERFECT if you pair it with an oil cleanser, as it is a little thick and has a hard time cleaning out the sebaceous filaments in your pores (I recommend DHC cleansing oil). The product can also be a little drying! So make sure you pair it with good products that replenish your skin moisture barrier (hyaluronic acid, good moisturizer like Laroche-posay or pods).

I came across this cleanser years ago on a YouTube video from a dermatologist I follow and she recommended this, but when you’ve tried almost everything you don’t have any hopes so I didn’t try it. I had try vinegar, baking soda with lemon. Baking soda with lemon does work but application is messy. Vinegar also works but is not very long lasting. Tea tree oil its also good, but then again, not that practical. I have tried every deodorant, the more effective were clinical degree in conjunction with vinegar cause on its own it doesn’t last. My armpits sweat too much and that in combination with bacteria creates BO. A couple of years I saw a video that recommended african black soap. I tried and it really worked, that’s when I realized that baby soap that my dermatologist prescribed for my atopic dermatitis was not doing a very good cleaning bacteria on my armpits. I bought another african black soap, but the bars were just too big and it came a mess easily, and it was not as good as the previous brand I used before. It is also worth mentioned that my body gets used to every new deodorant real fast. I then tried perspirex, which I used the blue one which is the strongest (up to 5 days) but I can only go as far as 3 days and my armpits where smelling again. I came across a tik tok video which recommended Panoxyl again, I decided to give it a try and bought it on Amazon without any high hopes. I tried immediately and it was the miracle I was waiting for. I used the 10% concentration and my armpits do not smell AT ALL. I use it like this: everyday when I shower, I put the tiniest bit amount on every armpit (a little goes a long way and remember too much can dry your skin), it says to give it a massage but I usually just leave it for 1-2 min and then remove it. Then I put The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid (This is a habit I created before trying Panoxyl and because I burned my skin using Perspirex 6 hrs after shaving, Glycolic Acid did help with hyperpigmentation and bad odor, but as the other remedies, it is not as long lasting) and I still use the same perspirex blue one that I first bought since I haven’t run out of it. I used perspirex after 5 days just because it says this is the longest you can go, but I didn’t have any BO, and the next day I still don’t smell anything. The only test that I haven’t done yet is under workouts as currently I can’t workout because I’m fasting, but before when I ended my workout my BO was really bad because of the sweating, but even if I haven’t tried it, I know it won’t disappoint as even when there’s an issue it will be fixed when you shower or you can do it just before the workout. I thank Panoxyl for this since I have fought BO since I was in my teen years, this gave me so much insecurity, I tried everything and still I didn’t smell good, which was really unfair and people always criticize. That’s why I’m leaving this review, maybe it can help somebody else. My sister had the same issue, a little more mild than me and now she is just as in love and recommended it to everyone we know that suffers from this. She uses The Ordinary’s Glycolic Acid and the Vichy red deodorant. On the face, I rarely have breakouts but this week I had two minor breakouts and this helped them cure really fast, asI guess it kills the bacteria. I only used it on the breakouts and not the rest of my face, as I’m scared it might dry out my skin and I have oily skin and live on tropical humid weather. If you are dry skin or live on colder or dryer place it might be best to watch out as the product could be drying or make your skin sensitive.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QBWQXV1VOX1D,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B081KL2QYJ,2024-03-28,189.0,positive,"['life', 'love']",0.9842,beauty

So, I bought ""The 6 Peptide Booster"" serum a couple of weeks ago, and I liked how fast I was seeing results. Then, a coworker told me about their moisturizer, and I just HAD to try it (along with their retinol cream and peptide eye cream). I could literally create an entire skin care routine using ONLY their products, because EVERYTHING I've tried, I have loved.

This particular product is just MADE for us oily/combination skin types! One thing I've heard folks with oily skin admit to is not using a moisturizer at all. I mean...it's your call, obviously, but if you're using any actives, you should definitely be moisturizing...unless you WANT wrinkles - again, your call! Dryness causes aging, which is why we oily skin types age slower than those with dry skin. When you use a retinoid or retinol or ANY actives to take care of acne, etc, you are speeding up the cell turnover rate, and you need those cells to slough off. If those cells are dry, they're going to stick and make you dryer, while holding the dry shape - the shape of wrinkles.

This moisturizer is PERFECT for anyone who is oily, because it itself is NOT oily. It soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I'm not sure how repairing it is just yet, but I'm currently using their retinol cream, and for the first time in...ever, I don't feel like my skin is on fire when I apply a moisturizer under my eyes. That could be their moisturizer or the gentleness of the retinol, or both. There's also ZERO smell, which is great for sensitive skin!

I HIGHLY recommend this product. I now have to buy another one for my 19-year-old daughter, because she saw me using it, wanted to try it, and she loved it too. The BEST part is that it's affordable enough to buy more! Which I may also have to do, because my 4-year-old son has eczema, and I am giving serious thought to trying it on him for the repairing factors and the fact that there aren't any concerning ingredients.

If you're on the fence, I'd say try it. I don't think you'll be disappointed!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G74TRVD8TLCP,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B01LEJ5MSK,2024-10-29,35.0,positive,"['great', 'perfect']",0.994,beauty

What I love most is how it helps to soothe redness and irritation while promoting healing from breakouts. I've seen a significant reduction in my acne scars, and my skin looks brighter and more radiant. Plus, it layers beautifully under makeup and other skincare products.

Ok so We all know that stress. Environmental elements can affect your physical, mental, emotional health, especially aging women that don't take care of their older skin. You if don't take care of yourself.
I have tried pretty much every skin care regimen that a woman can possibly try. As stated above, I am 50 years old. I still have breakouts from time to time. I have broken red capillaries on my face. I have large poors. I have wrinkles.  Don't get me started on finding a great foundation. I haven't found that yet but anyways. I ordered this product and I was not for sure about what to expect just by the pure name of it. LOL but I ordered it along with a couple of the other skin care products from the same brand.  And I immediately washed my face and used my little shaver to exfoliate and get rid of the fuzzies and applied everything that I bought including this product and my face felt immediately 10 times better, it was almost kind of instant the redness went away.  The appearance of my pores was very minimal. My face looked shiny, kinda rejuvenated. It's not oily, it's really slick. It's very viscous, slimy consistency.  There is no smell, it's not grainy, it is whitish in color goes on clear rubs right in it takes a minute for it to dry on your face so it's kind of I wanna say tacky, but after it dries on your face, it feels really smooth and it's almost kinda like it tightens your face when it dries, so that was kind of a nice effect.  So when it dries on your face and it tightens like it did, I almost felt like it tightened the pores on my face. So that was a good indication that it was kind of smoothing out the appearance of the large pores that I have.
Overall, I would suggest buying this despite the weirdness of it.  It's good I have extremely sensitive skin. I have T zone area so I'm part dry part oily. I get a bit of psoriasis or eczema behind my ears or whatever and around my nose and my laugh lines are super sensitive to different products, especially Vitamin C products which I will never buy again.  But my face gets Super dry and flaky. And this product did not do that at all. No burn effect either. Exceeded my expectations overall.

Great for sensitive skin!,"I’ve been using this face wash for the past year and it’s done my skin WONDERS !! 😫 My skin tends to be kinda dry but slightly oily in my t zone and around my nostrils. I’m also prone to breakouts, and anything scented tends to make things worse. I could never find a skincare routine that fully worked for me and made the breakouts stop. I was putting in SO MUCH WORK for little results, and then I started using this stuff and LET ME TELL YOU- MY SKIN HAS NEVER LOOKED/FELT SO GOOD !! At first, I noticed I was still dealing with some blemishes and almost stopped using this stuff cause I thought it was the face wash’s fault but it turns out it’s because I wasn’t using it properly (oops). Make sure to use a wash cloth when washing your face! I was uneducated and didn’t realize that by not using a wash cloth, I was leaving some of the face wash trapped on my skin and it was clogging my pores and causing the pimples. So make sure to AT LEAST use a clean wash cloth when rinsing it off, if not for the entire wash and rinse process. Also, this doesn’t just apply to this face wash, it’s apparently common skincare knowledge that I was just unaware of (like I said, it wasn’t the face wash’s fault y’all)! I now am happy to say that I haven’t had a breakout or uneven skin in many months. I make sure to use it twice a day, morning and night, and for me personally I apply Paula’s choice pore reducing toner with a cotton pad afterwards (use toner while your skin is still wet!) and then usually vitamin c serum, a couple drops of jojoba oil, and some spf on top during the day. I dab off any extra oiliness with a paper towel (don’t rub the paper towel on your face it’s not good for your poor sensitive skin 😭) At night I wash my face, use the toner, and then some jojoba oil, rosehip seed oil, or The Ordinary’s 1% retinol in squalane depending on what I feel my skin needs (also if you wanna start using a retinol serum, I highly recommend doing some research first so you know what you’re getting into/how often to use it!) overall, this stuff feels great on my face and isn’t too thick and it doesn’t leave any weird residue feeling like some face washes have in the past. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and balanced, no more dry or oily spots! I also love that the bottle is easy to take with me places because I travel a lot. It has a cool little c shaped clip that goes under the pump to keep it from leaking in your bag which is an honest lifesaver. The bottle is durable too/it’s not about to get crushed in my bag under all my stuff.

It will be a repurchase.

It is creamy, smooth, lightweight. It does not feel like an SPF product. It is so light and airy feeling.

My skin: mid 40s, clear, NON acne Rosacea (just visible veins, some flushing), normal to dry skin, semi sensitive--though less so since incorporating skin barrier building and protecting ingredients (hence my love of La Roche Posay products).

Yes, I love La Roche-Posay products. Seems there is something for everyone. I recommend checking out all they have to offer, and WHY. Such good ingredients. I have used their Toleraine creamy face cleanser, cicaplast baume, hydrating mask, assortment of sunscreens, and most recently this Toleraine Double Repair Face Moisturizer with SPF 30.

I tend to have a pretty solid skin care routine for night. For day time, it is pretty much whatever I feel like using, with emphasis on SPF. Most of the year I can do a combo of various morning products plus my SPF, but when it gets extra hot.. I just go with SPF because I will just sweat off good product. I am more apt to reapply during day as well as sometimes rinse my hot sticky face and then  reapply. I figured using a product that is both moisturizer AND SPF, as well as contain some other skin loving, skin barrier building goodies would be perfect. I immediately checked out the offerings of La Roche Posay, and am thrilled to have made this purchase.

Not to scare you off, as it didn't me, but I want to share.. At first, my skin seemed to flush pretty hard upon initial application. It didn't deter me from further use, since there is nothing in it that is troublesome. However, it is a new product for my skin, and it contains niacinamide which my skin never encountered before. Not too concerned, I continued to use it every morning. It seems to be even better as time goes on. I have been using it every single day for nearly a month. My skin didn't get red beyond the first couple of uses and seemed to simmer down a lot. My skin has also seemed mildly greasy at first (a never on my dry skin!), but that too simmered down with repeated use.  It looks really good, or extra good these days!!!!! My skin simply feels happily moisturized and at no point during day does it feel dry, nor does it feel greasy (not sure what that initial reaction was).  I feel like i have done something GOOD FOR MY SKIN when I use this. Hard no to recommend it :)

I have used it alone, I have used it over serums. I have used it under make up. I dont often wear make up, so I cant report much about my experience. When I do, I tend to use a little less than normal, let it set for awhile, then go back and add make-up. Usually my make up also has SPF.

It also isn't overly glossy or 'wet', so I don't feel like I'm wearing a bunch of goo or grease - or look like I was just eating extra oily foods.

I'm very pleased with the very light and natural tint it added. It's not 'overly purple' and I don't feel like I've got that 'obviously wearing lip gloss look'.  It just provides a nice natural shine and hydration with a very light tint and delicious scent.  It makes me look more awake, and the bright grape scent makes me FEEL more awake too!

I guess the only watch-out for others would just be to know that the name really DOES fit the scent, and inevitably, the flavor (because it's virtually impossible to not get ANY lip gloss in your mouth, even when you're trying to avoid it).

After purchasing some of the more expensive laneige ones, I decided to try this elf lip balm. I feel like these work so much better... and for so much less money!  I got two of them - peach & honeydew. The description says there's a sheet tint of color - I didn't find that to be true, to me they go on just like a clear balm. But I'm obsessed with the scents & the formula is non-sticky, in my opinion, just a good slick balm. Peach smells like the peach ring candies, and honeydew actually reminds me of the old B&BW scent cucumber melon. There's definitely a melon scent but it also has this ""fresh"" smell to it & the only thing I can think to compare it to is the fresh smell that cucumbers have. My teenage daughter actually stole my honeydew, so I had to come back & buy another one!
Final note is that they work really well. I haven't been drinking enough water recently, so my lips were really dry. I put this on at night before going to bed & the next morning, the dryness was significantly less. And after night 3, my lips were back to ""normal"" - no dryness!

It lighten a dark acne spot I had for about 6 months due to a cystic break out, I can guess in another week itll be gone. After the two passes you pad in the excess serum and i actually leave the oad over said mark until it dries. My face looks glowy and healthy even toned. Theres seriously magic in this stuff.
I LOVE that it comes with tweezers and the space in between the suction lid and regular lid is a perfect storage. I agree the packaging is bulky, this wont fit in a standard beauty bad thats how big it is. The box has clear instructions on how to use. Soy ink good for the environment good box packaging.

If you’re looking to even out your skin tone and tackle those stubborn dark spots caused by sun damage or acne scars, Medicube Deep Vita C Facial Pads might just become your new best friend. 🧡

The Good Stuff:

Dark Spots, Begone! These pads have seriously helped fade my sun spots and acne scars after a few weeks of use. I noticed my skin looking brighter and more even, which was exactly what I was hoping for.
Dual-sided Design: One side is textured for gentle exfoliation (kind of like a mini facial scrub), and the other is smoother for a softer finish. I love that versatility — it’s like a mini spa treatment in a pad.
Fragrance-Free Glory: I really appreciate that there’s minimal fragrance here. No overpowering scents, just pure Vitamin C goodness doing its job!
Proceed with Caution, Sensitive Skin Friends:
If you have sensitive skin like me, just a quick heads up: don’t go overboard! These pads pack a potent punch, and using them daily could lead to irritation (learned that the hard way). I found that using them every other night was the sweet spot — it gave my skin time to adjust without freaking out. Also, expect a little bit of a burn if you’re not used to Vitamin C this strong. It’s not unbearable, but you’ll feel the tingle for sure.

The Results:
Smooth, bright skin after day one? Check! Fewer breakouts and overall improved skin texture with continued use? Double check! These pads have definitely earned a spot in my nighttime routine, though I’d say less is more if your skin is on the sensitive side.

Final Thoughts:
Great for tackling uneven skin tone and scarring, but sensitive skin peeps, use with caution. With the right balance, these pads can leave your skin glowing like a ray of sunshine... but be sure to not go overboard!

I have 3 older sister’s we all have tried many brands over the years. As you age your skin looses its oil’s, and make your skin dryer than in your youth! Using a ph balanced soaps, makes all the difference in having youthful looking skin!

By using moisturizer you slowdown aging & help your skin from loosing it’s elasticity! Plus it helps aid you, from getting fine line wrinkles! We’re all die hard fans of Olay products, but just not in the shower anymore! Our grandmother fell in the bathtub and broke her hip at 68, she was never the same! She lived to be 94, but had to be monitored by health nurse. She walked with a limp, and ended up in a wheelchair for life!
🚫🫧🛀🏻🧼🛁🫧🚿🚫

At the age of 40 I switched out all of my hand soap pumps, to Oil of Olay body wash! I used it in every bathroom & even in the laundry room & my kitchen! Because using regular hand soaps, started to dry out the skin on my hands! I seen the noticeable differences, on my skin right away! I still use a moisturizing bath soaps, as my hand soap!

My grandmother had used Ivory, for generations!
She educated us on the importance of only using PH balanced soap’s on our skin for both bodies & hair! You can purchase PH test strips at most drug store! Including Amazon!

So Ivory was what my mom & the family used!
My grandmother told me that all Ivory dish soaps & bar soaps are PH balanced! That Ivory soap is gentle enough to use on a baby, and even on your hair! So If you should run out of shampoo! Worst case scenario, she said Johnson’s Baby Shampoo is another PH balanced soap! She advised us to keep some on hand, at all times as a backup plan for your householdl!

My sister Vicki lives in Las Vegas, she has a swimming pool in back of her house. She used Olay body wash, and had some by her outside shower. The whole pool area was cement, except the shower area it was done in a beautiful ceramic tile.

She was having a pool party, with some work friends over. She decided to buy some Olay body wash in a large pump for her outside shower! Along with some Shampoo & Conditioner. So her guest would feel comfortable, as the evening progresses!

She said three people slipped, and almost fell! So I said well, that was a law suit waiting to happen! So she changed to her Dove body wash, she had been using dove for years! As her personal facial soap, and bath soap. Vicki said she loved how creamy it was on her skin! That it’s the best soap in the market place! No offense to grandma of course❣️

We all collectively switched to Dove! DOVE DEEP MOISTURE, NOURISHING BODY WASH.

Just a heads up!
Hi I’m Kathi I live in Hawaii, my sister Vicki lives in Las Vegas, Patti lives in Iowa and Penni lives in Texas!

I use to use Olay body wash, until I almost fell in my shower! It is literally a health hazard! It has way too much oil in it, do your heavy moisturizing after you get out of the shower! It coated my whole bathtub, knobs, and the wall tiles with oil! It caused an oily build up over everything!

Using the spray on scrubbing bubbles, wasn’t cutting it anymore! I had to take Ajax & a scouring pad to remove it! Way too much back breaking work, at age 70 I only want convenience in my daily life! Olay bath wash just wasn’t cutting it for me! Great moisturizer but too greasy!

Like I said I had a very hard time scrubbing it off! It just became to much, to deal with loved the Olay moisturizing bath wash. But hated the mess it made & how slippery it made my bathtub!

I put one foot down & slid completely to the opposite side of the tub! I grabbed the wall to steady myself, and it was just as greasy! I thought for sure I was going down! My worst fears of ending up like my grandma! But thanks to a handicapped shower seat I have. I landed on it, but it scared the Bah-Jesus out of me!

Don’t get me wrong, I switched to Dove for it’s moisturizing soap & safety reasons, I’m sharing my experience with moisturizing bath & shower!

We love Olay products and use them all the time, but their bath wash has so much oil in it. We each had problems with slipping in the shower, it builds up in the bath tub! It scared us to the point of changing our brands, to using only Dove Body Wash! We were all pleasantly surprised, it moisturized our skin just as good as Olay bath wash! But even better, none of us has slipped do to oily build up DOVE WE LOVE YOU!
It’s our families #1 choice of bath & shower soaps! We even use it for our hand soaps too❣️
Couldn’t be happier with Doves products, so it will be passed down to our families future generations❣️🫧🛁🫧🛀🏻🧼🚿🫧

Fond memories, grandma would put all four of us little sisters. Into the bathtub together when we were young, she’d squirt Ivory dish soap in the tub & swish the soap around! Because we wanted a bubble bath, and bubble bath is what we got!
She was right about the PH balanced soaps’ ahead of her time she was! Because we grew up in the 1950’s❣️

True test of a good soap is a ph balance strip! Find out what’s in your soaps & hair products!
95% of the Shampoos & Conditioners sold in American stores, isn’t PH Balanced‼️🚫🧼🫧

Mahalo for your time!
We all feel safe using dove in the bathtub🫧 🛀🏻🧼& 🛀🏻🚿🫧and the shower❣️✅👌🏻👍🏻🤙🏻🫶🏻🤗💞

But I'm a firm believer that cosmetics and other skin products do not belong in the ""one-size-fits-all"" category.  Everyone has different skin types, issues, and lifestyles.  So the more info someone can get about how a product worked for a certain kind of person and how that person used it, the better they can decide if it's worth trying for themselves.

Read on if you want more info.  I'll put headers so you can skip to what you think is important.

*If you don't feel like reading, just know:  I'd mainly recommend this product as a subtle under eye brightener for someone with normal to dry or wrinkled/creased skin.  It's not the best product out there, but it does a great for the current price.  I think it's good value. It can work for someone who prefers a low maintenance skin routine or a person who really likes to experiment with cosmetics to achieve a specific look.)

WHICH COLOR I BOUGHT AND WHY:  I purchased the pink-toned undereye brightener since I have really fair (mostly neutral toned) skin.  The skin under my eyes can look very dull and dry sometimes, but it doesn't really turn a very noticeable dark tone.  Occasionally, it may take on a very faint bluish-purple hue.

WHAT DROVE ME TO TRY THIS SPECIFIC PRODUCT?  I actually bought this along with another product that promised to create a similar look, but which seemed like a formula that better fit my lifestyle.  (It came in small tube with an applicator and was waterproof.
I tend to look for cosmetics that offer convenience, can fit safely in my pocket without breaking, have maximum staying power, and that are non-comedogenic.)  However, I also decided to try this under eye brightener because I read that it was non-drying and kind of moisturizing.  I recently dried the heck out of the skin under my eyes, and I figured I needed something that could help with damage control until I could handle the other product.  (Waterproof and no-budge cosmetics tend to be drying.)
 I also liked how reviewers were consistently saying this product was very sheer, subtle, and not glittery or too sparkly.  I was on the hunt for something ""brightening"" as in illuminescent, glowing, or even slightly pearlescent.  I definitely did not want anything glittery, sparkly, metallic, etc.

WHAT IS MY SKIN TYPE & ANY ISSUES I'M HAVING RIGHT NOW THAT MAKES THIS PRODUCT IDEAL FOR ME?  I have combination type skin right now... oily in the T-zone, but more normal to dry around my cheeks and especially under my eyes.  I have to use an oil-controlling, mattifying product daily.  Otherwise, parts of my face will look outrageously shiny/greasy.
 But I kind of got lazy with my skin care and makeup routine as the weather got colder and dryer.  I started overusing the shine control products and applying it recklessly.  I was applying a super drying mattifying serum/primer all over my face... even blending it under my eyes, knowing I absolutely did not need any oil-absorbing or otherwise drying products in that specific area.

Next thing I knew, my undereye skin was dull and somewhat patchy looking.  My normal undereye concealer just wasn't cutting it anymore.  In fact, since my skin became so dried out, the various concealers I would normally use all looked streaky, creased, and/or dry within minutes to hours.  They made me look sloppy, tired, or older.  I did try using a heavier moisturizer around my eyes, and it was helping to get my skin back to normal... just not as quickly as I wanted.  And for some reason, it was causing some of my concealers to lose a lot of coverage power or to eventually settle on my face in a very streaky or creased way.

Then this little miracle finally arrived!

WHAT WAS MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THIS PRODUCT?  I was honestly skeptical when I first saw it and touched it.  It has a very pink tone when it's just sitting in the container.  There didn't appear to be anything ""brightening"" about it.  It looked like a thick, strongly pigmented salmon pink paste.  And then I touched it with my finger.  I would say it has a texture that's in between a gel-like cream and a balm.  Very slippery.  I was worried I just wasted my money on a weird pink-colored balm that was going to melt down my face within an hour or so.

I was wrong.  With this product, less is more.  (That also means there is a lot of product in the tiny pot. So for the price, it's an excellent value.)  The product applied smoothly under my eyes.  I didn't like how it looked at first, but I realized I had just applied too much... and I applied it over other makeup that had already dried out on my skin.  When I tried again with less product and a clean face, I was very happy with the results.

The product is VERY SHEER.  Don't expect it to cover any blemishes or really dark spots.  I wouldn't really call it shimmery either.  It basically reflects light in a way that makes your dull or slightly darkened skin less noticeable.  It has a subtle and natural looking effect.  The first time I wore it without any other cosmetics on, my daughter commented that I looked like I finally caught up on some sleep.  She actually asked to take a closer look at my face.  She noticed I looked ""better,"" but couldn't figure out why.  It's the perfect product for anyone trying to achieve the deceiving ""no makeup"" look.  (Not gonna lie... it feels good when people really believe you just naturally look youthful and vibrant.)

The makeup worked well with my moisturizer, and I feel like it helped restore my skin to it's normal state.  I'd say it has some moisturizing properties to it.  If anything, it's at least non-drying.

As far as longevity, this product doesn't have much staying power at all.  As my skin returned to a more normal state, the undereye cream became easier to accidentally wipe off or to just naturally fade away after a few hours.

I didn't dock a star for that because I kind of liked reapplying it mid-day. It feels slightly cooling.  I also found a work around for the longevity problem!

HOW I TYPICALLY USE IT:  I mostly use this undereye brightener to enhance my other plain undereye concealers (which are mostly medium coverage).  I'll mix the two products together on the back of my hand or directly on my face.  I get most of the coverage and staying power of my normal concealer, and the light reflecting and overall brightening properties of this product.  I sometimes apply it to my brow bone or the inner corners of my eye, too.  The other similar product I mentioned at the start of this review turned out to be very waterproof and smudge-resistant.  But it was also very drying, heavily pigmented, and difficult to blend despite being a liquid.  I found that it actually blends very well with this product, though.  And the two combined make for a brighter, less subtle look with enough staying power to last a good 14 hrs or so.  The two combined are better for carefully applying around the eyes with a makeup sponge for a contouring effect.

Basically, I found this undereye brightener to be great when used alone or to enhance other cosmetics.  I like it.  It's very versatile.

If you decide to try it, just make sure you're not allergic to any ingredients and you pick the appropriate color to match your skin tone and needs.  If it doesn't work well the first time you apply it, play around with it a bit.  My daughter is a very young adult. She has borrowed this eye brightener to rub on parts of her face for a natural-looking dewy, glowing complexion.  (I can't get away with that due to my combination type skin type.)

OTHER HELPFUL INFO:  If you're like me and rely on waterproof liquid eyeliner, you should know that this will negatively affect your eyeliner's staying power.  When the two cosmetics are overlapped at any point, the eyeliner seems to lose its water-resistance abilities.  In fact, this undereye cream can actually remove/dissolve some really strong waterproof liquid liners.  I think because it's kind of oily/greasy in a way.  (Kind of like Pond's cold cream will remove super stubborn eyeliner.
Except this eye brightener is not THAT strong.)

I only line the top of my lids, but my eyes kind of slope downwards.  So, I try to be careful not to blend this undereye cream too close to my lower lashline (in case it transfers to my upper eyelids) or too close to the outer sides of my eyes.  So far, that tactic had worked for me.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16XVRVE7BWKKE,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a7884193-fe40-4a68-9df4-f9feba949868._CR2,0,496,496_SX48_.jpg",True,B09V1CPTR1,2023-12-22,737.0,positive,"['great', 'versatile', 'perfect']",0.999,beauty

I don't exactly love it, but I kinda need it because my lashes are so light blonde that when I don't wear any, I look like I don't even have lashes. One complicated aspect of our relationship is either they change, or I do. I LOVED Tightline by It Cosmetics - even wore at my wedding - but they changed the formula and the product was drying up in less than two weeks. I wore the super cheap Essence waterproof mascara for a couple of years, then it started irritating my eyes; they could have changed something, or maybe I developed an allergy; I'm not sure. I even thought I had found a holy grail in Lancome's Définicils, but then *I* changed my esthetic and decided I wanted to wear brown to meld better with my strawberry blonde hair.

That's how I arrived here. I watched a strawberry blonde Tiktoker discussing her makeup routine, and she uses this in brown. She said it was a true brown, instead of a black-brown like most mascara companies make - which is kind of insulting to us, the customers who want/need a brown, but the companies think we're unsure of this and the difference between black and black-brown is not even noticeable when you have it on. 🙄 I don't know if I would consider this a ""true brown"", it's definitely not black, but it lacks the warmth and brightness of a true brown - like the brown of Cabaret's mascara (which is beautiful, but doesn't go on well and clumps terribly). The Sky High has a similar applicator, but the formula is much better - more smooth and creamy and not clumpy at all. It's also a tubing mascara, which, if you haven't tried a tubing, you don't know what you're missing! It stays put, but comes off with just warm water and a gentle tug. That is the biggest reason I'm giving it four stars: it DOES lengthen a LOT, without clumping or adding too much volume (I'm not a fan of the voluminous mascaras, myself; I prefer one that improves color and definition).

If you like black, or black-brown mascaras that will give you length, without adding volume, and prefer a rubbery,  spiny applicator over a thinner brush or spoolie type applicator, this one is for you. I just place more priority on color because I have none on my natural lashes and black can look too harsh on my fair skin and with my light-colored hair.

So, off I go! On my quest for the ""perfect"" mascara...",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AIVF8UM3G0RK,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B09VCXH9GF,2024-10-18,27.0,positive,"['perfect', 'love']",0.9944,beauty

My results are obvious!! The first ""after"" picture I took was such a stark difference I retook it to make sure the shadows/angle was the same (I took both pictures in the same bathroom, same lighting), and even after doing that the difference the mask made is wild for a single treatment.

I wanted to address the myth I've seen blasted all over the reviews posted here.
I have heard for a long time that vitamin c and retinol cannot be used together. That they cancel each other out. It's completely untrue. My problem is that I've heard it so many times. I believed it to be fact regardless of the sources I heard it from. Which is basically word of mouth by other women who do not hold a dermatological degree of any sort. I did my own research. And actual skin care experts that hold a degree say the opposite. Retinol CAN be used with vitamin c products. Successfully. They don't cancel each other out. They work beautifully together. And vitamin c actually helps retinol work BETTER by stabilizing it and extending its effectiveness. It turns out that using retinol without vitamin c or any other potent antioxidant is keeping your skin from reaping all the benefits of using retinol!!! Which is why this serum is so important in your skin care regimen. You know all those expensive anti aging moisturizers you've been blowing your money on? Well........without using this serum or any other serum close to this that has vitamin c in it prior makes your fancy skin cream ineffective. And we all want to get the most out of the money we spend to make our skin look fabulous. Don't we?
I've also seen reviews on here about this product complaining about the color change in the serum. Did they not read about the product? I states very clearly that it's normal to see variations of color. Clear or cloudy. All depending on the time of the year the ingredients are harvested contribute. And it is very clearly addressed in the description of this product. Pretty much cancelling out any of the bad reviews made on this product.
Ladies. If you want to make the most out of your skin care products. Read up on them first. That's why the info is there. So If anyone has any complaints on this product. They are not using it correctly!!!!!
I've included a photo in the first week of use. I will post more down the road. I am 40 years old. I smoked heavily for over 20 years(quit January 2017) and drank pretty bad too for 13 years before I got sober 7 years ago. My skin was terrible!!!! I have absolutely no makeup on. Just moisturizer and carmex lip balm. I use this product with a retinol moisturizer. I also take collagen daily as well. Hopefully this review helps clear up the myths of using certain anti aging products together. And their (in)effectiveness. Us ladies gotta stick together in this war on aging and kick some wrinkle butt!!!!

It says that the serum has more than likely lost its potency, but that it's still safe to use. Ugh... I already threw out the packaging, so I won't be returning it. I'll probably mix it with a hand lotion or something. I LOVED my first bottle! The serum actually got rid of some dark spots on my forehead and shrunk the pores around my nose. I wasn't expecting that. I plan on waiting a bit before I order another bottle, and hopefully they'll have fixed the problem by then.

I GOT 62 40 and 87,"Im new to this brand. I have 62. Which smells like pistachio caramel and vanilla. But in perfume form? Hard to describe. I use the body wash as lotion because i love layering like that. I got compliments the first time I wore this. It smells absolutely wonderful wonderful wonderful!!!!!!!! Seriously it smells awesome.

Perosonal tip: the vanilla and sweet notes dont mix well when your skin starts to sweat even a little. Actually no perfume does. Do you wonder if your perfume is offensive to others? I did. What works for me is to spray your perfume on your clothes not on your skin. It stays on for a lot longer! The smell on my sweater was there for a week after I first wore this! It absolutely has staying power which is unheard of for a body spray. Second, I store all my sprays in the fridge. They smell better and last longer and slows down the musky notes that perfumes tend to get.  Last, I spray this on my shirt and sleeves thirty mins before I leave the house. It smells way better than spraying right before you leave. And I am generous when I use this because its body spray not perfume.

I also got 40. It wasnt my favorite. It smells too flowery and old lady like. But still smelled very good in its own way.  Good enough I would wear this around the house. This line makes good scents what can I say.

Lastly, I got 87 which is my absolute favorite. This smells like coconut the beach and sunscreen. I personally love the smell of sunscreen! It doesnt have any creams you can buy unfortunately like the rest of the scents. What I do is use the chamomile conditioner from the Garnier line as lotion. Its the perfect match for me. This one smells sooo good. Theres no way this can be too strong. It just smells like pure happiness and super feminine. All three of these scents were blind purchases for me by the way.

The reviews for this helped me so much, I wanted to help someone out there that was thinking about buying one or many.

The mint is more dominant but I like the subtleness of the rosemary. Once it’s in your hair and dries i find it fantastic because then the rosemary is the pleasant without being overbearing.

Second; A little goes a long way! I use this while my hair is still damp then massage into scalp/brush it to spread into the length. You could add it to your ends as well, but for me my scalp is my target area because i have some thinning on my crown.

I know that it is going to take some time to see results. Nothing is an overnight miracle (we can dream!). I had some baby hairs already from using a rosemary mint conditioner (dr. Feels) a got this to suppliment on top of using that hoping it will speed up the growth I have. So i do have good faith this works for growth.

If regrowth is not your goal,no worries! My healthy hair has never felt better as well! I had very fine brittle pin straight hair but since incorporating this into my routine i have noticed its put some body and life back into it! So soft and i can see the difference in how much better it looks/feels. This was a big deal for me because this hair journey has been a looong struggle and finally seeing some results was enough to bring me to happy tears (and i am not a cryer!)

This is not an instant miracle product, but one that requires regular use over time. The oil is thin, absorbs quickly and helps alleviate itching.  It feels cool and medicinal on the scalp.
I began using this oil when I experienced some hair loss and have been satisfied with the results.  After a few weeks of regular use, I noticed the hair growing back in. Now, I use it less frequently.
The amber-colored glass bottle helps maintain the integrity of the product and not much oil is needed for daily application.  The scent is very strong, but not unpleasant; the mint and rosemary fragrances are distinct and you should be careful not to get any into your eyes.  It is not a product you might want to use before a romantic date; the smell might overpower your perfume and be rather jarring to someone else.  I've found bedtime to be the best time to apply this oil; after application, I cover my hair with a scarf to prevent oil stains on my linen.

I still have really long really thick hair, so you can’t really tell, but it just bothers me seeing that much hair in the shower and my hairbrush.. makes me wonder how much more hair I would have if I didn’t shed so much!!

Anyway, I came across this product in an effort to thicken my hairline. Originally, I came on here to get Minoxidil but somehow found this instead. I ended up purchasing this the shampoo, the conditioner, and the leave in. I did not get the hair mask because there were too many reviews of people saying it made their hair fall out too quick all at once in the beginning… Which if you look up hair growth products such as Minoxidil (Rogaine), that’s a possible side effect because it can cause a ton of shedding at once.. and that can freak people out.  Kinda scared me so I figured an essential oil would probably be safer, and there is tons of peer reviewed papers about the effectiveness of rosemary oil and hair growth by way of stimulating the hair follicle.

Just for reference, I have long thick brown hair (caucasian) and YES this is heavy on my hair if i’m not really careful how much I use, but I wear my hair up in a slicked pony/bun 7 days a week so it’s not a problem for me.  On the rare occasion that I wear my hair down, I use the shampoo and the conditioner and very very little leave in.  Tbh, I’m not that crazy about the leave in conditioner but I’m very happy with this particular product so I want to give it a chance.  The shampoo I really like, and the conditioner is pretty good, too.

Look I don’t want to jinx myself or anything lol but ever since the first day I put this oil on my scalp, I barely shed at all.  I wish I had pics.. the shower is so much less traumatic when i’m not losing so much hair every time I wash it.  At first, I used the dropper but that can be messy.. and since I have European hair, I can’t just put it on my scalp between braids.. so I had to get one of those oil dispensers that have the steel balls you roll over your scalp.  The only ones that actually work are the $25 range with a little red light and vibrations but well worth it.  I tried to be cheap and buy one for under $10 but that was a mistake because the oil wouldn’t come out and it was just too difficult.  I returned it and bought a different one with good reviews that works every time.  I usually dilute it with a little water just so it comes out easier.  I am so happy I found this product.

ps.  I never took a before picture… But I literally just washed my hair, took a pic of the drain collection, and came on here to update this. That little teeny TINY wad of maybe 20 hairs is my entire fallout from washing today. My hair is 24 inches and normally I lose 10 times that amount.. that’s underestimating.. It’s usually a legit handful of hair. Like this is nothing. I’m so excited to see how my hair looks when I actually keep the majority of it on my head instead of it going down the drain !!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFLZOPE5W8EQV,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8dcb50c7-d0da-4ffe-9360-0b6a26b43bc6._CR0,0,417,417_SX48_.jpg",True,B07N7PK9QK,2024-06-26,351.0,positive,[],0.9947,beauty

It's a bit pricier than some other scalp oils on the market.

Usage -
I apply a few drops of oil to my scalp, massaging it in gently. I leave it in for at least 30 minutes before washing my hair. I also use it as a pre-shampoo treatment once a week.

It helps to nourish and strengthen hair from the roots to the tips, promoting healthier growth and reducing breakage. Infused with rosemary and mint, it provides a cooling, soothing sensation that stimulates the scalp and improves circulation, which is beneficial for overall hair health.

Scent and Sensation: The rosemary and mint blend delivers a pleasant, invigorating scent that is both refreshing and relaxing. The minty aroma is not too overpowering, making it enjoyable to use as part of your hair care routine. The cooling effect on the scalp adds to the overall experience, creating a sense of revitalization.

Application and Use: The oil comes in a convenient dropper bottle, which allows for precise application directly to the scalp or along the hair shafts. This makes it easy to target specific areas that need extra care or to apply evenly throughout the hair. It can be used as a pre-shampoo treatment, a leave-in conditioner, or a styling aid, offering versatility in how you incorporate it into your routine.

Drawback: One minor drawback is that the oil’s consistency can be a bit thicker than expected, which may require more effort to distribute evenly through fine hair. For those with very fine or oily hair, it’s advisable to use sparingly to avoid weighing hair down.

Overall Impression: The Mielle Organics Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil is a high-quality product that provides effective nourishment and strength to all hair types. Its refreshing scent and versatile application make it a valuable addition to any hair care routine. Despite the minor issue with consistency, the oil delivers excellent results in promoting healthier, stronger hair and a revitalized scalp.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8TPI1HDI7SZF,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07N7PK9QK,2024-09-19,44.0,positive,['versatile'],0.9969,beauty

I have a really big issue with volume where i have to use multiple products to make my hair look like i have body. After i used this brush i didnt have to use any products. I love it!!

You do have to be careful bc it gets very hot. I got burned but thats just bc i held it wrong but it is SO easy to use.

Its also very good quality. Looks expensive!

I almost didn’t order it, because it’s not a body butter and it isn’t scented. However, I saw it listed in a popular weekly magazine as one of the top 50 beauty products of 2024. I figured they must know something I don’t, so I gave it a shot.

First, it’s a healthy sized jar; you get a decent amount for the low price. When I opened the jar, I was doubtful that the lightweight looking cream could penetrate the dry skin on my legs, but I was so very wrong! I put about a teaspoon of cream on each leg, and my skin started absorbing it like I’ve never seen before. As I massaged it in, I felt a new smoothness emerge quite quickly. My legs have never felt this good to the touch in the last 20 years. It did not leave a greasy residue, yet it worked better than a heavy body butter. I couldn’t detect a scent at all. In the morning, my legs still felt just as supple as when I applied it, so it seems to have staying power. I decided to put some on my face, and I wasn’t disappointed. My flaky t-zone disappeared immediately with no shiny afterglow.

No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to help for long—my skin would go back to feeling tight and irritated after just a few hours. That is, until I came across CeraVe Moisturizing Cream.

At first, I wasn’t expecting much, to be honest. I’d seen it mentioned here and there, but I thought it was just another hyped-up product. Well, I was so wrong! The first time I applied it, I could feel an instant difference. The cream is thick but not greasy—it absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling soft, hydrated, and calm, without that oily layer that some moisturizers leave behind. And the best part? It lasted all day. My skin felt nourished and smooth from morning until night.

What really sold me was that it’s developed with dermatologists and contains 3 essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid. These ingredients help to restore the skin’s natural barrier, which means it works long-term, not just as a temporary fix. Plus, it’s fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, so it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or cause breakouts.

I’ve been using it for months now, and honestly, I can’t imagine my routine without it. It’s become my go-to for both face and body, and I even carry a small tub with me when I travel. I’ve noticed that my skin is much healthier overall—less redness, more even texture, and just a natural glow that I never had before.

If you’re tired of dry, uncomfortable skin and want something that truly works, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is it. It’s affordable, effective, and backed by science.

Here’s my take after using it daily:

1. Hydration Power:
This cream provides deep, long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy or heavy. I have dry, sensitive skin, and CeraVe’s formula keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized all day. It’s especially great during the colder months when my skin tends to dry out faster.

2. Skin Barrier Support with Ceramides:
One of the best things about CeraVe is its ceramide-rich formula. The three essential ceramides work wonders to restore the skin’s natural barrier. I noticed a real difference in the texture and resilience of my skin after just a few uses—it feels smoother and healthier.

3. Non-Irritating & Suitable for Sensitive Skin:
It’s fragrance-free, which is a huge plus for anyone with sensitive skin or those prone to irritation. I’ve had issues with other creams that are too scented or harsh, but CeraVe has never caused any breakouts or redness. It’s also gentle enough for eczema-prone skin, and I’ve even seen dermatologists recommend it for this reason.

4. Texture & Absorption:
The cream is rich, but it absorbs well and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. A little goes a long way, so one tub lasts a good while, even with daily use on both face and body.

5. Versatile for Face & Body:
CeraVe is perfect for both face and body, so it’s a great all-in-one product. I use it on my hands, elbows, and anywhere that needs extra moisture, and it does the trick every time. It’s also a great base under makeup because it doesn’t feel oily.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PFV80XW5X9BE,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B00TTD9BRC,2024-11-09,3.0,positive,"['great', 'versatile', 'perfect']",0.9927,beauty

I humbly confess I was wrong and now I am a fan and a believer!! I just purchased the the mini-jar set (five (5) flavors) of the LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask. I've used the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask just three (3) nights so far and I am pleased to report: NO MORE DRY, FLAKY LIPS. Believe the hype y'all!! I followed the instructions provided by another Amazon Customer and purchased the Burt's Bee Overnight Lip Treatment (purple/mauve lid) and I apply that as a basecoat over my lips. Then I apply the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask on top of the Burt's Bee lip treatment and, voila! Just three (3) nights and three (3) nightly aplications later, I happy to report that I finally have soft, flake-free lips - which is honestly a MIRACLE since I live in a very dry area and have to deal with dry, flaky lips year-round. (My lips were so flaky and dry that they'd often crack and bleed.) The Laneige lip mask isn't too heavy or greasy at all. I actually find the texture and ""weight"" on my lips to be very pleasant and light, even when I layer it over the Burt's Bee Overnight Treatment Mask. Also, as somebody with sensitive, blemifhs-prone skin, it has not caused me any breakouts aroud my lips. In terms of flavor/scent, so far I've only tried the Gummy flavor/scent out of the set and, unless you love flavor and scent of grapes, I wouldn't recommend that particular flavor/scent. The set does come with a small silicone applicator (as pictured in the promo photos), which I recommend you get separately if, for some reason, your Laneige purchase doesn't come with a reusable applicator. In terms of quantity and size, the mini-jars are tiny but each jar actually has a decent amount of product. I only use 1/3-1/2 of an applicator scoop and there is plenty of product to cover my lips. My guess is that each jar will probably last ~ 2-3 months? Finally, in terms of price, the mini-jar set is a steal and it's a small price to to pay for healing my ultra-dry lips.

As a person with systemic lupus and fibromyalgia, I’m used to battling a lot of health issues and chronic fatigue/pain. I drink a lot of water every day, yet I still deal with chronic dry skin and unfortunately, even worse, dry lips. It takes every ounce of willpower I have not to bite or pick at the peeling dry skin on my lips and peel it off which only results in my lips cracking open and bleeding. I have tried every single brand ranging from bargains to more expensive products available at every brick & mortar store, including lanolin products, and Burt’s Bee’s chapstick, which only seemed to make matters worse. O’Keeffe’s Lip Balm is the only thing I can use during the day that somewhat helps me. After reading all of the really great reviews for Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, I decided to give it a try. I also noticed other people were leaving reviews who like me, previously had zero success no matter what they had tried before, were combining the Laneige WITH Burts Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment. Thanks to their experimentation & taking the time to write extensive reviews, I was also able to ensure that I ordered a silicone applicator and both products! I put each product on every night before bed, & I put both on every morning before I leave the for work, and I carry them in my purse just in case I’m extremely busy throughout my day & not hydrating as much as I should be, just to keep my lips from getting super chapped. I know many people have expressed hesitation about the price point of the Laneige product for the size of the container. However, I would argue that there ARE MAJOR, valuable benefits, including the quality and longevity of the product. It’s truly a long term investment for your skin care. You actually don’t use very much AT ALL! It takes such a MINUTE amount to achieve the desired results. I received mine a few months ago and I have hardly used any of it. Sincerely, if you’re like me, and so many others, & have been struggling for a long time trying to find something that will actually help your dry, cracked, & peeling lips, this is the product to accomplish your goal! I highly recommend also getting the Burt’s Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment with Ceramides (in the purple box) & get a silicone applicator, and go ahead and order a duo of the O’Keeffe’s Lip Balm for use throughout the day. Here’s my daily routine: After brushing my teeth and washing my face, using my silicone applicator, I apply the Burts Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment, then I apply the Vanilla Laneige Vanilla (careful to avoid applying too much at the corners of my mouth, I have sensitive skin that is prone to break outs) In the mornings, I repeat these same steps again, pack both items into my small make up bag and place it in my purse and voilà

I've been looking for a lip stain that lasts and was intrigued after seeing a dermatologist influencer use this in a video. This is tricky to use because the formula isn't very smooth. It's easy to miss spots when lining the lips, which then looks silly because the stain does last for several hours. No matter how well I think I have exfoliated and prepped my lips, it's a 50/50 chance that it will apply evenly. If I use it all over (not just lining lips) the color migrates into my mouth and stains my teeth. I've somewhat solved this by putting vaseline on my teeth and inner most area of my lips (where they start to curve in towards my teeth)  to lessen the migration and staining, but then my lips don't take the stain evenly no matter how careful I am to avoid getting it on my outer lips.

IT DOESN'T COME OFF and I tried taking it off because it wasn’t looking right on me! I was drinking coffee, drinking water and eating, but it was still on my lips. I put carmex on my lips all day as well, so it definitely stays.

I also want to note that I can’t stand wearing lip stains because I do not like when my lips feel dry, but this didn’t feel like that.  It was nice to have more of a tattoo-like color, vs. something that dries down. I love that I was able to put on my carmex throughout the day like usual, but I still had the lip color.

And the scent? Heavenly! It smells so good without being overpowering—like a light fruity or floral fragrance that makes using it even more enjoyable. The lightweight, non-sticky texture is the icing on the cake. It feels luxurious on the lips without that heavy, greasy feeling some glosses leave behind. You can feel the quality with every application. If you’re debating whether it’s worth the price—trust me, it is. It’s one of those products you’ll keep coming back to.

I purchased this balm years ago when it first launched. I have repurchased it ever since, and it was the product that introduced me to the brand.

The balm is phenomenal. Its claims are spot on - it moisturizes and volumizes, and the balm's texture fills in the lip lines, giving your lips a more youthful appearance. It's a lip treatment as well because the feel and look of my lips have improved since I started using it.

It works wonders for NYC summers and winters - something truly impressive since I usually prefer different textures depending on the season. Laneige is light enough for the heat, and protective and moisturizing enough for the cold.

Although I enjoy using all the flavors, my most repurchased is the Berry one. The tint is subtle, but it does a great job at effortlessly perfecting and enhancing the look of your natural lip. I use it on bare lips usually, but they all also pair well on top of liner and lipstick.

I always thought that the original lip mask and the Berry balm were the same thing in different packaging, but they are not. The lip mask feels a little bit heavier with more emollience than the lip balm. Although the color looks similar, the balm has a more noticeable tint to it, while the mask looks clear once applied.

It's on the thicker side (when compared to other similar products), with a gel-like texture, however, it's not gloopy or sticky. It doesn't get stuck in my hair, and it also stays put - no bleeding outside the lip lines. Each balm smells like its designated flavor.  It has a pleasant barely-there scent that isn't overpowering. We all know that we end up ingesting a bit of whatever we put on our lips. The balm doesn't taste like anything. It's not sweet, but also not disgusting. It's something like a mild Aquaphor or Vaseline. Not something you'd really notice.

Laneige's balms & masks will continue to hold that holy-grail status with me for years to come.

Again, this works well when using the device, but it is pretty thick and actually kind of sticky with it rating for 1-5 with 5 being very sticky, it's about a 2.5. If you're not using the medicube device, then it doesn't work very well as a conductive gel. I have other devices, and when I use this product with it, you can't feel the microcurrent....now if you don't like the feeling of microcurrent, then this is for you, but I like to know that something is working. Another thing is that it doesn't absorb very well...like if you're using the device, eventually it changes consistency, and at first I figured I'd leave it on...but now I prefer to wash it off, as the thickness would make it impossible for other products to absorb. I don't have sensitive skin, but I'm semi-prone to acne, and this hasn't caused me to break out, which is great, because otherwise I couldn't use it at all.

The main thing is, how well does it work?  For me, it works very well indeed for both nose and ears.

Given that the cutting head is small and round, you do have to develop a bit of a technique when using it. Tip: insert it, slowly rotate it and move it around a bit and listen while doing so -  you'll probably be able to hear when it's cutting hairs.

The features that like:

Seems nicely made for the price - battery end cap and clear blade cover are easy to grasp and fit on securely. Decent sliding power switch.

It's a good size, and fits comfortably in my medium/large sized guy hands. Not too small to drop, and it just does the one thing (there's no attachments) so it's not too big, either.

Reasonably quiet operation.

It uses a single AA battery.  Personally I prefer this over a rechargable.

While it's near perfect, there's one small caveat, hence my 4.5-star rating.

The quality of each tool in this set is excellent. From the nail clippers to the cuticle pushers, each piece is made with care and precision, ensuring a clean and hassle-free manicure at home. The tools are sharp where they need to be, yet safe to use, making them perfect for both beginners and seasoned users.

One feature that stands out is the comfort and ease of handling. Each tool is ergonomically designed, allowing for precise control and reducing the risk of accidental slips or nicks. This quality craftsmanship extends to the case too. It's stylish and compact, ideal for both home use and travel.

However, it's this compactness that brings me to the minor issue I've found with this set. Given its small size, it's quite easy to misplace or lose, especially when traveling. If you're someone who tends to forget where they put things or if you're constantly on the go, this is something to consider. Perhaps attaching a brightly colored tag or a keyring could be a solution to keep track of it better.

That being said, this minor inconvenience doesn't detract from the overall excellence of the manicure set. The tools are durable and effective, making nail care a breeze. They've retained their sharpness and functionality even with regular use, a testament to their quality.

In conclusion, if you're in the market for a manicure set that provides professional-level care at home, this product is a fantastic choice. Just remember to keep an eye on it due to its small size. Despite this minor flaw, this manicure set stands out in the crowded field of personal care products and is certainly worth the investment.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD259DYI02YBC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",True,B07GGR1N4Y,2023-07-15,26.0,positive,"['durable', 'perfect']",0.9956,beauty
